      "all_post_contents ['TL;DR - GitLab makes an egregious billing mistake, refuses to fix it, and tells a GitLab evangelist to go pound salt. If you purchase it, examine the order closely.\\n\\nSo, a little background on me: I started at a software company years ago in an IT position. Our traditional software development toolchain was overly complicated for my liking, so I set up GitLab. \\n\\nI did so well with it that I became my company\\'s first DevOps Engineer, and I got dev teams to make the switch. Not only did I present on GitLab at work, I took my GitLab evangelism on the road to enthusiasts in the area - I.E. the local Linux User Group.\\n\\nNot long ago, I ordered some GitLab licenses since more people wanted to use it. I asked to go from 57 to 75 licenses. Instead, GitLab put the order in wrong and *added* 75 licenses, bringing us to 132 total.\\n\\nAbout this time, I was pulled to a critically-important project that was way behind schedule and told not to work on anything else. When I got enough breathing room to switch back, our account manager acted like she couldn\\'t care less. The most I ever got was \"I\\'ll be sure to look into it\" or \"I\\'m still looking into it\".\\n\\nThe process dragged on for weeks. I had to nag her over and over again for updates until she finally told me that GitLab\\'s billing department had decided... not to give me a refund because it had been *too long*. How convenient, especially after dragging out the process for so long.\\n\\nI complained about this, asked for a new account manager, and got what I requested. Our new account manager took my concerns to the GitLab crew again... and got told once again that not only would we not receive a refund, GitLab wasn\\'t going to offer us any sort of compensation or credit whatsoever.\\n\\nWe\\'re a software company as well, and we would *never* treat loyal customers this way - *especially* not our power users. I\\'ve built my DevOps career around GitLab and encouraged others to do the same. That GitLab could be so tone-deaf over a problem that was clearly their fault speaks volumes to how the company has changed.\\n\\nI\\'m grateful for what GitLab has provided. It\\'s still a good product, even if I\\'m gravely concerned about its future. But I\\'m hanging up my GitLab evangelist hat. A few of my company\\'s senior developers are interested in GitLab alternatives, and I\\'ve given the thumbs-up to do a proof-of-concept with one of them later this year.\\n\\nIf you choose to use GitLab in your organization, check your bills carefully.\\n\\nUPDATE #1: Someone from GitLab\\'s \"Developer Evangelism team\" reached out to me privately and offered to look more into this.\\n\\nUPDATE #2: I did eventually get my money back, and Sid (GitLab CEO) responded to the email that I wrote him.', \"# What's going on?\\n\\nA  recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party  mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in  the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.\\n\\nOn  May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make  calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third  party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).\\n\\nEven  if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a  step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit  Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface .\\n\\nThis  isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators  depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their  communities on-topic and spam-free.\\n\\n# What's the plan?\\n\\nOn June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently*  unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't  able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through  the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what  we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\\n\\nThe two-day blackout isn't the *goal*,  and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of  Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and  buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.\\n\\nWhat can *you* do?\\n\\n1. **Complain.** Message the mods of [r/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/).com, who are the admins of the site: message [/u/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/reddit/): submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on [r/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/), such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.\\n2. **Spread the word.**  Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch  about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit  join us at our sister sub at [r/ModCoord](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/)  \\\\- but please don't pester mods you *don't* know by simply spamming their modmail.\\n3. **Boycott** ***and*** **spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite *non*\\\\-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!\\n4. **Don't be a jerk.**  As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be  worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every  effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as  possible. **This includes not harassing moderators of subreddits who have chosen not to take part**: no one likes a missionary, a used-car salesman, or a flame warrior.\", \"I wrote up\\xa0[a few examples](https://medium.com/swlh/why-your-load-test-will-hide-problems-and-lead-to-crashes-in-production-585b6258e67d)\\xa0sharing some lessons from load testing on high traffic websites.\\n\\nI've worked with some systems that required very high stability -- either millions of dollars or millions of visitors at stake.\\n\\nI have seen a few common mistakes in load testing that make it virtually impossible to find and fix the real bottlenecks and bugs.\\n\\nCorrecting those to get a good test showed what needed to be fixed (and what couldn't be changed), so it was easy to adapt the system and solve the problems. It's nice to see others in the organization go from complaining about stability to raving about how solid things are :)\\n\\nWhen it's done properly it can be a great tool for preventing issues and assuring everyone that the system is stable.

I\\'m currently in the process of evaluating alternative technologies for our local development environment. So far we\\'ve managed okay with a massive Docker Compose file. But the trouble is there\\'s a lot to manage since we\\'re using different tools to develop (Docker + local builds) than we are when deploying (Kubernetes). And although I have been able to mitigate a lot of our issues using my own suite of automation scripts, I am spending too much time helping others getting their environment in a workable state. So the plan was to take a look at some of these \"Internal Development Platform\" technologies to see if I can leverage some of this.\\n\\nThe tools I\\'ve had a go with so far are Tilt, .NET Aspire (we primary do .NET here), and Skaffold.\\n\\nSo far, the best experience I\\'ve had is Tilt. But one glance at their website and it\\'s immediately obvious that it\\'s not exactly a project bustling with activity. The docs, while great initially, quickly fall off once you start wanting to do more complicated stuff or integrate it with modern build solutions, especially in the web space. I\\'m also looking at that \"Big News! Tilt is Joining Docker\" header that\\'s been there for years at this point and getting bad vibes. I also don\\'t like that it templates the Helm instead of installing it properly, but this is a really minor complaint.\\n\\nThen we have .NET Aspire. It\\'s still very early and very Microsoft\\'ey. There are some neat ideas in there for .NET devs, but it\\'s just not a good general solution if you\\'re not developing specifically .NET on the Azure platform. FOSS is a distant afterthought here and it feels very obvious this just isn\\'t a viable path. Instead of making Kubernetes development easier, they just pretend it doesn\\'t exist by abstracting it away, becoming unnecessary middlemen in the process. It\\'s just alpha, but it\\'s a fundamentally flawed product in my opinion.\\n\\nLastly, I\\'ve been at it with Skaffold. We don\\'t develop in Google Cloud but it shouldn\\'t really matter for what we need it to do. What I care about is making the setup process as easy and painless as possible while retaining the close relationship between local and production environment. However, then I come across an issue where I can\\'t inject environment variables into the YAML configuration file... But only for specific properties. So essentially a massive inconsistency in the core the design IMO. Then I come to learn it\\'s been like this for 2 years but no one got around to really doing anything about it. Shifting priorities I suppose? Also, honestly not the best documentation in my opinion.\\n\\nIt all feels so... incomplete? I feel like the current landscape is quite barren in terms of good solutions to this -- I assume -- very understood and manageable problem. Develop something into a local cluster with minimal effort. Maybe I\\'m missing something, going about things the wrong way, lack the skills necessary, I\\'m honestly not trying to be a person who just complains.', 'Working in the observability and monitoring space for the last few years, we have had multiple folks complain about the lack of detailed monitoring for messaging queues and Kafka in particular. Especially with the coming of instrumentation standards like OpenTelemetry, we thought there must a better way to solve this.\\n\\nWe dived deeper into the problem and were trying to understand what better can be done here to make understanding and remediating issues in messaging systems much easier.\\n\\nWe would love to understand if these problem statements resonate with the community here and would love any feedback on how this can be more useful to you. **We also have shared some wireframes on proposed solutions, but those are just to put our current thought process more concretely. We would love any feedback on what flows, starting points would be most useful to you.**\\n\\nOne of the key things we want to leverage is distributed tracing. Most current monitoring solutions for Kafka show metrics about Kafka, but metrics are often aggregated and often don’t give much details on where exactly things are going wrong. Traces on the other hand shows you the exact path which a message has taken and provides lot more details. One of our focus is how we can leverage information from traces to help solving issues much faster.\\n\\nPlease have a look on a detailed blog we have written on the some problems and proposed solutions.

I also have that resource's definition in HCL. So far, perfect.Due to <reasons> however, the resources is not being tracked and is therefore not part of the current state. When I plan, I see it wants to create it anew. When I apply, it of course fails. So far, all good.Here's my problem now - when I import the resource into the state, it says it successfully did the import. HOWEVER, 1) the resource is not part of the list of updated resources and 2) it hasn't became part of the state for real.How is that even possible? I imported the resource correctly following its specific import syntax. In my case it's using an ID identifier, not an ARN.This is in stark contrast with another resource which was also not part of the state but which I was able to import successfully.Has anybody seen that behaviour before?

By that time I was already a part-time devops with that team, and full-time building my own project. The project was not specifically designed for solving this kind of problem, but it was ideologically pretty close, so we decided to try to turn what we had into a tool that would help us harvest these issue-reports from Slack and turn them into a structured log of work items, RCAs, playbooks, etc. The whole experiment is still work in progress, but in the meantime I'm trying to gather more information and see if we should focus more on this case and deliver a tool specifically for DevOps teams.

The group I am a part of (5 people, not including my manager) is in charge of keeping all of the hardware for the 7,000 machines up-and-running in addition to ensuring that all of the custom-built software is running in a manner which doesn\\'t impact customers.\\n\\nMy group was recently formed (about 5 years ago) and I\\'ve been working in it for 3 (this is my first \"real\" job - I have degrees in EE, CS, and Networked Systems).  The group was formed by taking a developer (my now-manager), promoting him to manager, and two operation\\'s folk (they\\'ll do anything you ask, as long as all the steps are listed clearly as 1), 2), 3) and there is no ambiguity and every command works flawlessly) as the senior personnel - and has slowly been grown from there.\\n\\nI am very frustrated by my current position and I have no idea where to go or how to improve the situation at work.  My mandate (from my manager) is to \"keep the network running\" and to \"automate away work\" (which I feel puts me squarely in DevOps space).  However, due to department policy, I do not have any access to the code-base and so I can only make non-deployed code systems and only when I am not working on operations work.\\n\\nI currently have little to no say in how the systems I have to support will be developed, or what \"fixes\" will be worked on by the development team, who can touch the code (in fact, the last time I pushed really hard to get a system fixed, the dev manager put the entire project on \"freeze\" and said it will no longer be supported).\\n\\nOur systems are fairly wide and varied (map-reduce like system, admittance system, completion tracking system, 2 report serving systems, hadoop clusters with in-house management software, a USA-wide archival system, a system to get data from the archive, etc, etc) and while I have a jack-of-all trades understanding of all the systems, they are nearly unmanageable (we get several hundred tickets everyday from anything from disks going down to customer\\'s complaining about their reports not being present -> which we don\\'t have any monitoring around).  I\\'ve worked on some of our procedures, but I run into a lot of red-tape.  For instance, I tried to get a program together to analyze the hardware on our machines for issues and to report it, but my manager stopped it because \"this is the job for other department <x>\" and when I talked to <x> they said \"everything is working as intended\".\\n\\nAs a newb to the entire arena, I haven\\'t been able to figure out how to convince anyone, including myself, what needs to be worked on - let alone prioritized.  \\n\\nMy manager allows me to pick my own tasks, mainly because whenever I point out a problem he immediately puts me in charge of it, including coming up with the project plan, convincing co-workers to donate their time (non of these are resourced), finding my own time, measuring my own success on the project, and more.\\n\\nI haven\\'t been able to convince my manager, the dev manager, or their manager (the department manager) to commit to any internal SLAs for any of the services either.  Typically, the response is along the lines of \"why would we do that?\" (how do you explain the importance of maintaining a quality of service?) or \"what do you think they should be?\" followed by \"we don\\'t want to commit to that / how would we even commit to that?\" when I bring in suggestions.\\n\\nCurrently, when I\\'m not working on day-to-day operations, I am trying to write a document which describes the services we offer (no, we don\\'t already have one) with the hope that I can start gathering SOME metrics to define each of the services (for instance, how much data do we currently have in archive and how is it partitioned by type?) in a manner towards defining the health of the service (not that I\\'m super positive about management agreeing as to what the health of a service should be).\\n\\nI\\'m tired of running into instances of working long hours some weeks and being told by the development team \"the workload will drop as you get better at doing the operations\".  Simultaneously, I don\\'t know what to do when there\\'s a lull in the operational workload (like right now) and I could just sit around all day doing nothing.\\n\\nAt this point, I\\'m not sure if I\\'m in way over head (and should start looking for another job), or if there\\'s some starting point for converting the system into something more operator-friendly.\\n\\ntldr;  I am very frustrated trying to do DevOps work as part of an operations team in company where Dev and Ops don\\'t work together at all, should I:\\n* Find another job?\\n* Forget about improving the system and just take my paycheck (I get paid well for an operations-only position)?\\n* Work on revolutionizing the department by doing <Y> first, where <Y> is ???', '**Working with Terraform can be difficult and cumbersome, but it’s still worth it.**  \\n\\n\\n## BACKGROUND STORY\\n\\nBack in 2015, when I first found out about Terraform, it looked like a Valhalla to me. Terraform was about to solve the issue of provisioning complicated infrastructure – bringing together worlds of multiple cloud providers – ranging from multi-purpose giants like AWS to one-solution providers like Logentries.\\n\\nTogether with my team we decided, that we need something to deal with the infrastructure complexity we have. For a platform based on Heroku and AWS, scaled horizontally to four clones Terraform seemed like a perfect solution. We wanted to have something that would let us realize the idea of Infrastructure as a Code – a must for a\\xa0[DevOps enabled](https://smarketshq.com/devops-is-a-culture-not-a-title-prefix-b825b44dfcda)\\xa0team. Advanced and feature-full Terraform is, it doesn’t come free – there is a couple of issues that you should be aware of.\\n\\nI will enumerate the ones that hurt us the most, and show you our means to deal with them. In the end, I will try to convince you that even with those challenges, there is a lot of room for Terraform in the tooling space.\\n\\n## THE PAINS\\n\\n### 1. THE EVIL STATE\\n\\nFirst thing you will complain about, when it comes to Terraform, is the fact that it’s stateful, and the implications it brings. I personally consider two issues that it brings:\\n\\n* the state has to be in sync with the infrastructure all the time – that also means that you have to go all-in when it comes to provisioning – i.e. no stack modifications can be made outside of the provisioning tool\\n* you have to keep the state somewhere – and this has to be a secure location as state has to carry secrets\\n\\nBut there is a reason why the state was introduced into Terraform. It’s there to maintain the mapping between the resources represented in your definition files and the actual resources created within cloud providers. Having that, Terraform can give you a couple of advantages:\\n\\n* reading the state from providers (state syncing, also called refreshing), can be quite time-consuming. If we could be 100% sure that the state is accurate, we could totally resign from that, and apply the change right away\\n* having ability to follow the resources that already have been created, we can easier apply renames and restructuring modifications – simply an infrastructure refactoring\\n* when it comes to state, Terraform requires it to be locked before applying the changes. That means that we can assure that while we are applying changes no-one else does.\\n\\nI think when considering provisioning tool you should weigh up above arguments and make sure if your stack is more of a clean-sheet kinda thing, that can be recreated every time you change something, or is it rather a living organism that requires modifications while it’s still running.\\n\\n### 2. HARD TO START WITH THE EXISTING STACK\\n\\nBack in the early days of Terraform, its issue tracker was full of complaints from people not being able to leverage Terraform with the existing stack. The reason for it was the fact, that Terraform was not able to incorporate it into the state (to my amazement, while looking for a sign of this, I’ve found\\xa0[my old PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/875)\\xa0that was trying to address that issue back then 📷 ). Fortunately, the import command was introduced, and this problem has been solved (at least at the system level).\\n\\nBut here comes another issue that is tightly connected to this – if your stack is large you are doomed to issue\\xa0terraform import  \\n\\xa0command multiple times for each resource, that is already there. Without some nifty automation/scripting, it could be really time consuming and frustrating. When you think about it, it would be nice to import such things in a bit more smart way. This however would require Terraform to treat resources not as a flatland of resources, but as a tree. In some cases, it makes perfect sense – have a look at\\xa0heroku\\\\_app  \\n\\xa0vs\\xa0heroku\\\\_domain  \\n\\xa0or\\xa0heroku\\\\_drain.  \\n\\xa0There is certainly a lot of room for improvement in that space.\\n\\n### 3. COMPLICATED STATE MODIFICATIONS\\n\\nThere is one additional thing that is a bit problematic when dealing with the state. While constantly refactoring your infrastructure definition, you may end up renaming resources (changing their identifiers) or moving them deeper into modules. Such changes are unfortunately hard for Terraform to follow, and leave it in a state where it doesn’t know that certain resources are simply misplaced. If you run\\xa0apply  \\n\\xa0again, you will end up in resource recreation, which is probably not something You always want. The good news is that there is a\\xa0terraform state mv  \\n\\xa0command that allows you to move the logical resource around the state. The bad news is that in most of the cases you will need a lot of those.\\n\\n### 4. TRICKY CONDITIONAL LOGIC\\n\\nThere are some people around the web who doesn’t like the fact that Terraform is not really an actual imperative programming language. To be perfectly honest I don’t share that opinion – I think the provisioning definition of the stack should be as declarative as it can – that leaves a lot less space for some deviations in the definitions. On the other hand, the conditional logic provided by Terraform is a bit tricky. For example to define a resource that is conditionally provisioned you make the resource to be a list, and use the count parameter to control it:\\n\\n\\\\[snippets & more examples on the blog\\\\]:\\n\\n[https://www.schibsted.pl/blog/9-reasons-why-terraform-is-a-pain-and-1-why-you-should-still-care/](https://www.schibsted.pl/blog/9-reasons-why-terraform-is-a-pain-and-1-why-you-should-still-care/)\\\\]', 'Originally from the [NopSec blog](https://www.nopsec.com/blog/know-thyself-environment/?utm_source=social&utm_campaign=reddit)\\n\\nPost by Nick Michalos\\n\\nSecuring an environment is a constant game of cat-and-mouse. Safety measures of all kinds can (and should) be put in place to protect against malicious actors, downtime, and other business impacting variables. A production stack can be an extremely complex system with dozens of applications, databases, networking security groups, user permissions, etc., so what are some of these safety measures and practices that can be used, and whose responsibility is it to make sure the stack is safe? The developers? Yes. Sys admins? Yep. DevOps? You bet. The point here is that everyone has a role in an organization’s security whether it’s obvious or not. Let’s take a look into the DevOps realm and see what these engineers can do to prevent, detect, and remediate potentially damaging issues.\\n\\n\\nLet’s first consider DevOps as the gatekeeper of Production - the Gandalf yelling “You shall not pass” at any engineer whose changes don’t meet some criteria. Typically one of these gatekeepers should be looking for a few things and asking some important questions:\\n\\nSuccessful test results - Is that your final answer? A hard requirement of proof of correctness of changes will help ensure that bug fix updates will actually fix issues, prove that other components aren’t newly broken, and provide repeatable steps to test features further on down the line.\\n\\nSupportability - How do we know this feature is working and how do we troubleshoot? Imagine being a Tier-1 support engineer when a customer calls you up complaining something isn’t working. It’s now your job to investigate and support the issue, and you start by digging into the logs. Hmm, no luck there... nothing relevant can be found. Now you happen to check the code repository for this feature and find that you’re flying totally blind. There’s no logging whatsoever! Now you’re stuck either jumping into a shell desperately trying to reproduce the issue or escalating up the chain just to try to get an idea of what could be going wrong. What a bottleneck. Relevant, concise logging is a must-have throughout all of the moving pieces of an application\\n\\nWhat about documentation? Thorough documentation would be fantastic to be able to quickly reference and resolve. Imagine having a go-to handbook with “In the event of ‘X’ do ‘Y’.” That would certainly make things a bit easier.\\n\\nHolding your own application code base to a high standard may be tedious sometimes, but the return on investment, even if it’s just peace of mind, is tremendous.\\n\\n\\nNow we’ll assume changes are in, approved, and ready to move up the environment chain destined for Production greatness and the DevOps engineer’s role is to usher them into the next environment. We could ‘scp’ a .tar.gz over to our host, or run a pull/checkout with our favorite source control tool directly on the host, but then we’ll realize it’s not 2006 anymore. The fundamental problems with these manual approaches are that they are not repeatable to scale, they’re very susceptible to user error (one of the many reasons ‘manual’ is a four-letter word in Ops), and they’re not guaranteed to yield the same results between executions. A better solution is to leverage an automation/orchestration framework such as Ansible, Puppet, or Chef that will give order to your deployments and eliminate the chaos. Chaos introduces uncertainty in an environment, and uncertainty means insecurity. These tools provide us with human-readable “playbooks”, “manifests”, “recipes” and other trendily named configuration mechanisms that will guarantee our deployment coverage for updates. These tools can not only deploy your own application, but keep all operating system packages up to date and effectively get your hosts to exact desired states.\\n\\nOur updates are now in production with the latest and greatest features. The odds are pretty good that our production environment isn’t just a single host running a static website without any other services supporting it behind the scenes. There’s probably a database to hold some dynamic content, a session caching application to let users log in, maybe an ElasticSearch server for fast search functionalities, and some other auxiliary service applications. Now the job is to stand up and protect Production from the outside world. Someone new to setting up a Production environment may stand all of these applications up on separate hosts, see that everything’s working, and call it a successful day.\\n\\nWhere this falls short is the [implied] lack of consideration for putting services on internet-facing hosts. If your backend database that holds your customer data is accessible to the general internet, you’re going to have a bad time. Very careful knowledge of which applications communicate with which services will help an engineer set up correct private networks and firewall rules to make sure service exposure throughout the stack is safely deployed and configured. An additional environmental strategy that is often overlooked is the creation and use of ‘service users’ on a server to apply even more restrictions on sensitive applications.\\n\\nHaving to actively manage all of these moving parts can seem daunting, but as we discussed earlier, automation is your friend. All of these setups and configurations can be organized and implemented with the orchestration tools mentioned before, and if they are, future update needs can be almost seamless and completed on the order of minutes. Imagine having to update an environment of hundreds of Linux servers to patch Java (not hard, I know) manually. This could take forever, but if instead you use Ansible you can roll that update out automatically to all hosts, in batches, or however you’d like in a repeatable, predictable manner. Personally, I love these tools. They cut down massively on deployments to all environments (including development with Vagrant!), are very easy to use, and help work and iteration move quickly. Though I praise these tools for their power, it’s not to say that if used incorrectly they can’t wreak some irrevocable havoc. After all, there’s still the end-user element, and we mustn’t forget the PEBCAK phenomenon. A real-world scenario was recently reported but found to be a hoax on the serverfault.com forum, but the risk of what was alleged is not too farfetched. User bleemboy claimed to have “rm -rf”-ed his entire company away with Ansible automation. Because these tools are designed to run what you, the user, tell them to, this could happen under the right (or very, very wrong) conditions.\\n\\nTo wrap up, enforcing policies and procedures in an organization geared towards ensuring certainty of code, packages, and permissions, will help mitigate security risk tremendously.  Automation and orchestration of these policies will open up a world of heightened control and insight to an environment putting a maintainer in a fantastic spot to deploy and manage source code and packages to respond to security issues easily and efficiently. Now go… automate all the things and such…\\n\\n\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nPuppet - [https://puppet.com/](https://puppet.com/)\\n\\nAnsible - [https://www.ansible.com/](https://www.ansible.com/)\\n\\nChef - [https://www.chef.io/](https://www.chef.io/)\\n\\n[http://serverfault.com/questions/769357/recovering-from-a-rm-rf](http://serverfault.com/questions/769357/recovering-from-a-rm-rf)', 'Respect to Resend for their transparency in publishing this post mortem, but this is one of your worst nightmares:\\n\\n>While building a feature, we performed a database migration command locally, but it incorrectly pointed to the production environment instead, which **dropped all tables in production**.\\n\\nProd database wiped and a twelve hour outage - ouch.\\n\\n[https://resend.com/blog/incident-report-for-february-21-2024](https://resend.com/blog/incident-report-for-february-21-2024)\\n\\n&#x200B;', \"Resume:\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/RuDmov0\\n\\nI've strongly considered just rewinding, getting a 4-year Bachelors in CS, and going into something like full stack like I used to do.

Currently, I have a GitLab Runner running as a Docker container on my host machine, which executes tasks in my GitLab CI pipeline. In my\\xa0`.gitlab-ci.yml`\\xa0file, I specify a different custom Docker image—one with Ansible Core and Terraform installed—to run the tasks. I believe this setup is referred to as\\xa0**Docker-in-Docker**.\\n\\nMost tasks are working fine, including Terraform\\xa0`init`,\\xa0`validate`,\\xa0`plan`, and\\xa0`deploy`. The\\xa0`tfstate`\\xa0files are correctly handled during the Terraform part. However, the final task, which involves running an Ansible playbook on a newly-built VM, fails with a \"network unreachable\" error. I’m not sure where the network issue is occurring.\\n\\nInterestingly, if I\\xa0`docker exec`\\xa0directly into the GitLab Runner container, I can ping and SSH to the remote host without any issues. However, when the pipeline runs, it fails to establish an SSH connection inside the task container?!\\n\\nHere’s the relevant command I’m using in the pipeline:\\n\\n    ANSIBLE_PASSWORD=$admin_password ansible-playbook -i my_artifact post-config.yml\\n\\nMy question is: Does anyone know how to fix this issue? I’m unsure how the networking works between the custom container (used to run Ansible) and the GitLab Runner container. Do I need to specify the network mode as\\xa0`host`\\xa0for the job?

When the review turns out dozens of feedback items that amount to formatting and non-operational readability changes, developers tend not to go back and edit the code. \\n\\nThis is why so many teams have gone to continuous review via mob programming or pair programming instead. It occurs while the developers are in the current assignment and changes are made immediately.\\n\\nIf you like to stay with code reviews, then there’s the need to go beyond a checklist when creating and shipping features. I feel like there are some steps in a checklist that are taking way too long  (for example; time for code reviews) and others are just unnecessary (for instance; wasting so much time fixing lots of cosmetic/aesthetic issues during your code reviews) and also manually doing things that can be automated.  \\nIn your own experience what are some things in a code review checklist that has become a bottleneck and why.', 'Hello, \\n\\nI am trying to run a workflow on Github Action, with job in a custom container.\\n\\nAll works well until I try using Action depending on Node, where I get the error:\\n\\n>OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process: exec: \"/\\\\_\\\\_e/node20/bin/node\": stat /\\\\_\\\\_e/node20/bin/node: no such file or directory: unknown\\n\\nAfter more research, I found multiple topic talking about simular issues. \\n\\n[https://github.com/actions/setup-node/issues/922](https://github.com/actions/setup-node/issues/922)\\n\\n[https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/334](https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/334)\\n\\nFrom what I understand,  it appears this is due to problem with dynamic linking of NodeJs with some libs on the host. \\n\\nOk cool, but, how do I fix that?

      "all_post_contents ['TL;DR - GitLab makes an egregious billing mistake, refuses to fix it, and tells a GitLab evangelist to go pound salt. If you purchase it, examine the order closely.\\n\\nSo, a little background on me: I started at a software company years ago in an IT position. Our traditional software development toolchain was overly complicated for my liking, so I set up GitLab. \\n\\nI did so well with it that I became my company\\'s first DevOps Engineer, and I got dev teams to make the switch. Not only did I present on GitLab at work, I took my GitLab evangelism on the road to enthusiasts in the area - I.E. the local Linux User Group.\\n\\nNot long ago, I ordered some GitLab licenses since more people wanted to use it. I asked to go from 57 to 75 licenses. Instead, GitLab put the order in wrong and *added* 75 licenses, bringing us to 132 total.\\n\\nAbout this time, I was pulled to a critically-important project that was way behind schedule and told not to work on anything else. When I got enough breathing room to switch back, our account manager acted like she couldn\\'t care less. The most I ever got was \"I\\'ll be sure to look into it\" or \"I\\'m still looking into it\".\\n\\nThe process dragged on for weeks. I had to nag her over and over again for updates until she finally told me that GitLab\\'s billing department had decided... not to give me a refund because it had been *too long*. How convenient, especially after dragging out the process for so long.\\n\\nI complained about this, asked for a new account manager, and got what I requested. Our new account manager took my concerns to the GitLab crew again... and got told once again that not only would we not receive a refund, GitLab wasn\\'t going to offer us any sort of compensation or credit whatsoever.\\n\\nWe\\'re a software company as well, and we would *never* treat loyal customers this way - *especially* not our power users. I\\'ve built my DevOps career around GitLab and encouraged others to do the same. That GitLab could be so tone-deaf over a problem that was clearly their fault speaks volumes to how the company has changed.\\n\\nI\\'m grateful for what GitLab has provided. It\\'s still a good product, even if I\\'m gravely concerned about its future. But I\\'m hanging up my GitLab evangelist hat. A few of my company\\'s senior developers are interested in GitLab alternatives, and I\\'ve given the thumbs-up to do a proof-of-concept with one of them later this year.\\n\\nIf you choose to use GitLab in your organization, check your bills carefully.\\n\\nUPDATE #1: Someone from GitLab\\'s \"Developer Evangelism team\" reached out to me privately and offered to look more into this.\\n\\nUPDATE #2: I did eventually get my money back, and Sid (GitLab CEO) responded to the email that I wrote him.', \"# What's going on?\\n\\nA  recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party  mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in  the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.\\n\\nOn  May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make  calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third  party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).\\n\\nEven  if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a  step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit  Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface .\\n\\nThis  isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators  depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their  communities on-topic and spam-free.\\n\\n# What's the plan?\\n\\nOn June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy.

I\\'m currently in the process of evaluating alternative technologies for our local development environment. So far we\\'ve managed okay with a massive Docker Compose file. But the trouble is there\\'s a lot to manage since we\\'re using different tools to develop (Docker + local builds) than we are when deploying (Kubernetes). And although I have been able to mitigate a lot of our issues using my own suite of automation scripts, I am spending too much time helping others getting their environment in a workable state. So the plan was to take a look at some of these \"Internal Development Platform\" technologies to see if I can leverage some of this.\\n\\nThe tools I\\'ve had a go with so far are Tilt, .NET Aspire (we primary do .NET here), and Skaffold.\\n\\nSo far, the best experience I\\'ve had is Tilt. But one glance at their website and it\\'s immediately obvious that it\\'s not exactly a project bustling with activity. The docs, while great initially, quickly fall off once you start wanting to do more complicated stuff or integrate it with modern build solutions, especially in the web space. I\\'m also looking at that \"Big News! Tilt is Joining Docker\" header that\\'s been there for years at this point and getting bad vibes. I also don\\'t like that it templates the Helm instead of installing it properly, but this is a really minor complaint.\\n\\nThen we have .NET Aspire. It\\'s still very early and very Microsoft\\'ey. There are some neat ideas in there for .NET devs, but it\\'s just not a good general solution if you\\'re not developing specifically .NET on the Azure platform. FOSS is a distant afterthought here and it feels very obvious this just isn\\'t a viable path. Instead of making Kubernetes development easier, they just pretend it doesn\\'t exist by abstracting it away, becoming unnecessary middlemen in the process. It\\'s just alpha, but it\\'s a fundamentally flawed product in my opinion.\\n\\nLastly, I\\'ve been at it with Skaffold. We don\\'t develop in Google Cloud but it shouldn\\'t really matter for what we need it to do. What I care about is making the setup process as easy and painless as possible while retaining the close relationship between local and production environment. However, then I come across an issue where I can\\'t inject environment variables into the YAML configuration file... But only for specific properties. So essentially a massive inconsistency in the core the design IMO. Then I come to learn it\\'s been like this for 2 years but no one got around to really doing anything about it. Shifting priorities I suppose? Also, honestly not the best documentation in my opinion.\\n\\nIt all feels so... incomplete? I feel like the current landscape is quite barren in terms of good solutions to this -- I assume -- very understood and manageable problem. Develop something into a local cluster with minimal effort. Maybe I\\'m missing something, going about things the wrong way, lack the skills necessary, I\\'m honestly not trying to be a person who just complains.', 'Working in the observability and monitoring space for the last few years, we have had multiple folks complain about the lack of detailed monitoring for messaging queues and Kafka in particular. Especially with the coming of instrumentation standards like OpenTelemetry, we thought there must a better way to solve this.\\n\\nWe dived deeper into the problem and were trying to understand what better can be done here to make understanding and remediating issues in messaging systems much easier.\\n\\nWe would love to understand if these problem statements resonate with the community here and would love any feedback on how this can be more useful to you. **We also have shared some wireframes on proposed solutions, but those are just to put our current thought process more concretely. We would love any feedback on what flows, starting points would be most useful to you.**\\n\\nOne of the key things we want to leverage is distributed tracing. Most current monitoring solutions for Kafka show metrics about Kafka, but metrics are often aggregated and often don’t give much details on where exactly things are going wrong. Traces on the other hand shows you the exact path which a message has taken and provides lot more details. One of our focus is how we can leverage information from traces to help solving issues much faster.\\n\\nPlease have a look on a detailed blog we have written on the some problems and proposed solutions.

The biggest problem was with the accountability of the time spent on ad-hoc debugging and the overall visibility of what's going on in the dev infra. Our team lead was pushing for a change and wanted to add more structure to the process, without upsetting too many of the infra-team clients. By that time I was already a part-time devops with that team, and full-time building my own project. The project was not specifically designed for solving this kind of problem, but it was ideologically pretty close, so we decided to try to turn what we had into a tool that would help us harvest these issue-reports from Slack and turn them into a structured log of work items, RCAs, playbooks, etc. The whole experiment is still work in progress, but in the meantime I'm trying to gather more information and see if we should focus more on this case and deliver a tool specifically for DevOps teams. The tool would help them\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Gather issue reports, questions, feature requests, etc from Slack\\n* summarize them and create objects in 3-rd party systems (JIRA, PD, Confluence, <anything else>)\\n* potentially help with retrieving these objects back right in Slack and matching them onto new reports\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**It would help me greatly if you could answer a few questions about your team:**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Does your team also uses Slack for discussing ad-hoc issues or do you force everyone to file a ticket first?\\n* Have you ever looked into solving the issue of consolidating this information from Slack?\\n* How would rate the amount of time you spend on **\\\\[doing planned work\\\\]%** vs. **\\\\[debugging incidents reported by automation (e.g. PD alerts)\\\\]%** vs. **\\\\[working on ad-hoc stuff requested by other people\\\\]%**\\n* What systems does your team use for communication, ticketing, incident tracking, knowledge management?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLastly, here's a [link to an article](https://blog.onebar.io/track-incident-reports-in-onebar-1cb14065d8ce) where I tried to describe what we currently have, but I'm not really trying to validate whether our current approach is valid or not.

The group I am a part of (5 people, not including my manager) is in charge of keeping all of the hardware for the 7,000 machines up-and-running in addition to ensuring that all of the custom-built software is running in a manner which doesn\\'t impact customers.\\n\\nMy group was recently formed (about 5 years ago) and I\\'ve been working in it for 3 (this is my first \"real\" job - I have degrees in EE, CS, and Networked Systems).  The group was formed by taking a developer (my now-manager), promoting him to manager, and two operation\\'s folk (they\\'ll do anything you ask, as long as all the steps are listed clearly as 1), 2), 3) and there is no ambiguity and every command works flawlessly) as the senior personnel - and has slowly been grown from there.\\n\\nI am very frustrated by my current position and I have no idea where to go or how to improve the situation at work.  My mandate (from my manager) is to \"keep the network running\" and to \"automate away work\" (which I feel puts me squarely in DevOps space).  However, due to department policy, I do not have any access to the code-base and so I can only make non-deployed code systems and only when I am not working on operations work.\\n\\nI currently have little to no say in how the systems I have to support will be developed, or what \"fixes\" will be worked on by the development team, who can touch the code (in fact, the last time I pushed really hard to get a system fixed, the dev manager put the entire project on \"freeze\" and said it will no longer be supported).\\n\\nOur systems are fairly wide and varied (map-reduce like system, admittance system, completion tracking system, 2 report serving systems, hadoop clusters with in-house management software, a USA-wide archival system, a system to get data from the archive, etc, etc) and while I have a jack-of-all trades understanding of all the systems, they are nearly unmanageable (we get several hundred tickets everyday from anything from disks going down to customer\\'s complaining about their reports not being present -> which we don\\'t have any monitoring around).  I\\'ve worked on some of our procedures, but I run into a lot of red-tape.  For instance, I tried to get a program together to analyze the hardware on our machines for issues and to report it, but my manager stopped it because \"this is the job for other department <x>\" and when I talked to <x> they said \"everything is working as intended\".\\n\\nAs a newb to the entire arena, I haven\\'t been able to figure out how to convince anyone, including myself, what needs to be worked on - let alone prioritized.  \\n\\nMy manager allows me to pick my own tasks, mainly because whenever I point out a problem he immediately puts me in charge of it, including coming up with the project plan, convincing co-workers to donate their time (non of these are resourced), finding my own time, measuring my own success on the project, and more.\\n\\nI haven\\'t been able to convince my manager, the dev manager, or their manager (the department manager) to commit to any internal SLAs for any of the services either.  Typically, the response is along the lines of \"why would we do that?\" (how do you explain the importance of maintaining a quality of service?) or \"what do you think they should be?\" followed by \"we don\\'t want to commit to that / how would we even commit to that?\" when I bring in suggestions.\\n\\nCurrently, when I\\'m not working on day-to-day operations, I am trying to write a document which describes the services we offer (no, we don\\'t already have one) with the hope that I can start gathering SOME metrics to define each of the services (for instance, how much data do we currently have in archive and how is it partitioned by type?) in a manner towards defining the health of the service (not that I\\'m super positive about management agreeing as to what the health of a service should be).\\n\\nI\\'m tired of running into instances of working long hours some weeks and being told by the development team \"the workload will drop as you get better at doing the operations\".  Simultaneously, I don\\'t know what to do when there\\'s a lull in the operational workload (like right now) and I could just sit around all day doing nothing.\\n\\nAt this point, I\\'m not sure if I\\'m in way over head (and should start looking for another job), or if there\\'s some starting point for converting the system into something more operator-friendly.\\n\\ntldr;  I am very frustrated trying to do DevOps work as part of an operations team in company where Dev and Ops don\\'t work together at all, should I:\\n* Find another job?\\n* Forget about improving the system and just take my paycheck (I get paid well for an operations-only position)?\\n* Work on revolutionizing the department by doing <Y> first, where <Y> is ???', '**Working with Terraform can be difficult and cumbersome, but it’s still worth it.**  \\n\\n\\n## BACKGROUND STORY\\n\\nBack in 2015, when I first found out about Terraform, it looked like a Valhalla to me. Terraform was about to solve the issue of provisioning complicated infrastructure – bringing together worlds of multiple cloud providers – ranging from multi-purpose giants like AWS to one-solution providers like Logentries.\\n\\nTogether with my team we decided, that we need something to deal with the infrastructure complexity we have. For a platform based on Heroku and AWS, scaled horizontally to four clones Terraform seemed like a perfect solution. We wanted to have something that would let us realize the idea of Infrastructure as a Code – a must for a\\xa0[DevOps enabled](https://smarketshq.com/devops-is-a-culture-not-a-title-prefix-b825b44dfcda)\\xa0team. Advanced and feature-full Terraform is, it doesn’t come free – there is a couple of issues that you should be aware of.\\n\\nI will enumerate the ones that hurt us the most, and show you our means to deal with them. In the end, I will try to convince you that even with those challenges, there is a lot of room for Terraform in the tooling space.\\n\\n## THE PAINS\\n\\n### 1. THE EVIL STATE\\n\\nFirst thing you will complain about, when it comes to Terraform, is the fact that it’s stateful, and the implications it brings. I personally consider two issues that it brings:\\n\\n* the state has to be in sync with the infrastructure all the time – that also means that you have to go all-in when it comes to provisioning – i.e. no stack modifications can be made outside of the provisioning tool\\n* you have to keep the state somewhere – and this has to be a secure location as state has to carry secrets\\n\\nBut there is a reason why the state was introduced into Terraform. It’s there to maintain the mapping between the resources represented in your definition files and the actual resources created within cloud providers. Having that, Terraform can give you a couple of advantages:\\n\\n* reading the state from providers (state syncing, also called refreshing), can be quite time-consuming. If we could be 100% sure that the state is accurate, we could totally resign from that, and apply the change right away\\n* having ability to follow the resources that already have been created, we can easier apply renames and restructuring modifications – simply an infrastructure refactoring\\n* when it comes to state, Terraform requires it to be locked before applying the changes. That means that we can assure that while we are applying changes no-one else does.\\n\\nI think when considering provisioning tool you should weigh up above arguments and make sure if your stack is more of a clean-sheet kinda thing, that can be recreated every time you change something, or is it rather a living organism that requires modifications while it’s still running.\\n\\n### 2. HARD TO START WITH THE EXISTING STACK\\n\\nBack in the early days of Terraform, its issue tracker was full of complaints from people not being able to leverage Terraform with the existing stack. The reason for it was the fact, that Terraform was not able to incorporate it into the state (to my amazement, while looking for a sign of this, I’ve found\\xa0[my old PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/875)\\xa0that was trying to address that issue back then 📷 ). Fortunately, the import command was introduced, and this problem has been solved (at least at the system level).\\n\\nBut here comes another issue that is tightly connected to this – if your stack is large you are doomed to issue\\xa0terraform import  \\n\\xa0command multiple times for each resource, that is already there. Without some nifty automation/scripting, it could be really time consuming and frustrating. When you think about it, it would be nice to import such things in a bit more smart way. This however would require Terraform to treat resources not as a flatland of resources, but as a tree. In some cases, it makes perfect sense – have a look at\\xa0heroku\\\\_app  \\n\\xa0vs\\xa0heroku\\\\_domain  \\n\\xa0or\\xa0heroku\\\\_drain.  \\n\\xa0There is certainly a lot of room for improvement in that space.\\n\\n### 3. COMPLICATED STATE MODIFICATIONS\\n\\nThere is one additional thing that is a bit problematic when dealing with the state. While constantly refactoring your infrastructure definition, you may end up renaming resources (changing their identifiers) or moving them deeper into modules. Such changes are unfortunately hard for Terraform to follow, and leave it in a state where it doesn’t know that certain resources are simply misplaced. If you run\\xa0apply  \\n\\xa0again, you will end up in resource recreation, which is probably not something You always want. The good news is that there is a\\xa0terraform state mv  \\n\\xa0command that allows you to move the logical resource around the state. The bad news is that in most of the cases you will need a lot of those.\\n\\n### 4. TRICKY CONDITIONAL LOGIC\\n\\nThere are some people around the web who doesn’t like the fact that Terraform is not really an actual imperative programming language. To be perfectly honest I don’t share that opinion – I think the provisioning definition of the stack should be as declarative as it can – that leaves a lot less space for some deviations in the definitions. On the other hand, the conditional logic provided by Terraform is a bit tricky. For example to define a resource that is conditionally provisioned you make the resource to be a list, and use the count parameter to control it:\\n\\n\\\\[snippets & more examples on the blog\\\\]:\\n\\n[https://www.schibsted.pl/blog/9-reasons-why-terraform-is-a-pain-and-1-why-you-should-still-care/](https://www.schibsted.pl/blog/9-reasons-why-terraform-is-a-pain-and-1-why-you-should-still-care/)\\\\]', 'Originally from the [NopSec blog](https://www.nopsec.com/blog/know-thyself-environment/?utm_source=social&utm_campaign=reddit)\\n\\nPost by Nick Michalos\\n\\nSecuring an environment is a constant game of cat-and-mouse. Safety measures of all kinds can (and should) be put in place to protect against malicious actors, downtime, and other business impacting variables. A production stack can be an extremely complex system with dozens of applications, databases, networking security groups, user permissions, etc., so what are some of these safety measures and practices that can be used, and whose responsibility is it to make sure the stack is safe? The developers? Yes. Sys admins? Yep. DevOps? You bet. The point here is that everyone has a role in an organization’s security whether it’s obvious or not. Let’s take a look into the DevOps realm and see what these engineers can do to prevent, detect, and remediate potentially damaging issues.\\n\\n\\nLet’s first consider DevOps as the gatekeeper of Production - the Gandalf yelling “You shall not pass” at any engineer whose changes don’t meet some criteria. Typically one of these gatekeepers should be looking for a few things and asking some important questions:\\n\\nSuccessful test results - Is that your final answer? A hard requirement of proof of correctness of changes will help ensure that bug fix updates will actually fix issues, prove that other components aren’t newly broken, and provide repeatable steps to test features further on down the line.\\n\\nSupportability - How do we know this feature is working and how do we troubleshoot? Imagine being a Tier-1 support engineer when a customer calls you up complaining something isn’t working. It’s now your job to investigate and support the issue, and you start by digging into the logs. Hmm, no luck there... nothing relevant can be found. Now you happen to check the code repository for this feature and find that you’re flying totally blind. There’s no logging whatsoever! Now you’re stuck either jumping into a shell desperately trying to reproduce the issue or escalating up the chain just to try to get an idea of what could be going wrong. What a bottleneck. Relevant, concise logging is a must-have throughout all of the moving pieces of an application\\n\\nWhat about documentation? Thorough documentation would be fantastic to be able to quickly reference and resolve. Imagine having a go-to handbook with “In the event of ‘X’ do ‘Y’.” That would certainly make things a bit easier.\\n\\nHolding your own application code base to a high standard may be tedious sometimes, but the return on investment, even if it’s just peace of mind, is tremendous.\\n\\n\\nNow we’ll assume changes are in, approved, and ready to move up the environment chain destined for Production greatness and the DevOps engineer’s role is to usher them into the next environment. We could ‘scp’ a .tar.gz over to our host, or run a pull/checkout with our favorite source control tool directly on the host, but then we’ll realize it’s not 2006 anymore. The fundamental problems with these manual approaches are that they are not repeatable to scale, they’re very susceptible to user error (one of the many reasons ‘manual’ is a four-letter word in Ops), and they’re not guaranteed to yield the same results between executions. A better solution is to leverage an automation/orchestration framework such as Ansible, Puppet, or Chef that will give order to your deployments and eliminate the chaos. Chaos introduces uncertainty in an environment, and uncertainty means insecurity. These tools provide us with human-readable “playbooks”, “manifests”, “recipes” and other trendily named configuration mechanisms that will guarantee our deployment coverage for updates. These tools can not only deploy your own application, but keep all operating system packages up to date and effectively get your hosts to exact desired states.\\n\\nOur updates are now in production with the latest and greatest features. The odds are pretty good that our production environment isn’t just a single host running a static website without any other services supporting it behind the scenes. There’s probably a database to hold some dynamic content, a session caching application to let users log in, maybe an ElasticSearch server for fast search functionalities, and some other auxiliary service applications. Now the job is to stand up and protect Production from the outside world. Someone new to setting up a Production environment may stand all of these applications up on separate hosts, see that everything’s working, and call it a successful day.\\n\\nWhere this falls short is the [implied] lack of consideration for putting services on internet-facing hosts. If your backend database that holds your customer data is accessible to the general internet, you’re going to have a bad time. Very careful knowledge of which applications communicate with which services will help an engineer set up correct private networks and firewall rules to make sure service exposure throughout the stack is safely deployed and configured. An additional environmental strategy that is often overlooked is the creation and use of ‘service users’ on a server to apply even more restrictions on sensitive applications.\\n\\nHaving to actively manage all of these moving parts can seem daunting, but as we discussed earlier, automation is your friend. All of these setups and configurations can be organized and implemented with the orchestration tools mentioned before, and if they are, future update needs can be almost seamless and completed on the order of minutes. Imagine having to update an environment of hundreds of Linux servers to patch Java (not hard, I know) manually. This could take forever, but if instead you use Ansible you can roll that update out automatically to all hosts, in batches, or however you’d like in a repeatable, predictable manner. Personally, I love these tools. They cut down massively on deployments to all environments (including development with Vagrant!), are very easy to use, and help work and iteration move quickly. Though I praise these tools for their power, it’s not to say that if used incorrectly they can’t wreak some irrevocable havoc. After all, there’s still the end-user element, and we mustn’t forget the PEBCAK phenomenon. A real-world scenario was recently reported but found to be a hoax on the serverfault.com forum, but the risk of what was alleged is not too farfetched. User bleemboy claimed to have “rm -rf”-ed his entire company away with Ansible automation. Because these tools are designed to run what you, the user, tell them to, this could happen under the right (or very, very wrong) conditions.\\n\\nTo wrap up, enforcing policies and procedures in an organization geared towards ensuring certainty of code, packages, and permissions, will help mitigate security risk tremendously.  Automation and orchestration of these policies will open up a world of heightened control and insight to an environment putting a maintainer in a fantastic spot to deploy and manage source code and packages to respond to security issues easily and efficiently. Now go… automate all the things and such…\\n\\n\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nPuppet - [https://puppet.com/](https://puppet.com/)\\n\\nAnsible - [https://www.ansible.com/](https://www.ansible.com/)\\n\\nChef - [https://www.chef.io/](https://www.chef.io/)\\n\\n[http://serverfault.com/questions/769357/recovering-from-a-rm-rf](http://serverfault.com/questions/769357/recovering-from-a-rm-rf)', 'Respect to Resend for their transparency in publishing this post mortem, but this is one of your worst nightmares:\\n\\n>While building a feature, we performed a database migration command locally, but it incorrectly pointed to the production environment instead, which **dropped all tables in production**.\\n\\nProd database wiped and a twelve hour outage - ouch.\\n\\n[https://resend.com/blog/incident-report-for-february-21-2024](https://resend.com/blog/incident-report-for-february-21-2024)\\n\\n&#x200B;', \"Resume:\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/RuDmov0\\n\\nI've strongly considered just rewinding, getting a 4-year Bachelors in CS, and going into something like full stack like I used to do.

Currently, I have a GitLab Runner running as a Docker container on my host machine, which executes tasks in my GitLab CI pipeline. In my\\xa0`.gitlab-ci.yml`\\xa0file, I specify a different custom Docker image—one with Ansible Core and Terraform installed—to run the tasks. I believe this setup is referred to as\\xa0**Docker-in-Docker**.\\n\\nMost tasks are working fine, including Terraform\\xa0`init`,\\xa0`validate`,\\xa0`plan`, and\\xa0`deploy`. The\\xa0`tfstate`\\xa0files are correctly handled during the Terraform part. However, the final task, which involves running an Ansible playbook on a newly-built VM, fails with a \"network unreachable\" error. I’m not sure where the network issue is occurring.\\n\\nInterestingly, if I\\xa0`docker exec`\\xa0directly into the GitLab Runner container, I can ping and SSH to the remote host without any issues. However, when the pipeline runs, it fails to establish an SSH connection inside the task container?!\\n\\nHere’s the relevant command I’m using in the pipeline:\\n\\n    ANSIBLE_PASSWORD=$admin_password ansible-playbook -i my_artifact post-config.yml\\n\\nMy question is: Does anyone know how to fix this issue? I’m unsure how the networking works between the custom container (used to run Ansible) and the GitLab Runner container. Do I need to specify the network mode as\\xa0`host`\\xa0for the job?

When the review turns out dozens of feedback items that amount to formatting and non-operational readability changes, developers tend not to go back and edit the code. \\n\\nThis is why so many teams have gone to continuous review via mob programming or pair programming instead. It occurs while the developers are in the current assignment and changes are made immediately.\\n\\nIf you like to stay with code reviews, then there’s the need to go beyond a checklist when creating and shipping features. I feel like there are some steps in a checklist that are taking way too long  (for example; time for code reviews) and others are just unnecessary (for instance; wasting so much time fixing lots of cosmetic/aesthetic issues during your code reviews) and also manually doing things that can be automated.  \\nIn your own experience what are some things in a code review checklist that has become a bottleneck and why.', 'Hello, \\n\\nI am trying to run a workflow on Github Action, with job in a custom container.\\n\\nAll works well until I try using Action depending on Node, where I get the error:\\n\\n>OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process: exec: \"/\\\\_\\\\_e/node20/bin/node\": stat /\\\\_\\\\_e/node20/bin/node: no such file or directory: unknown\\n\\nAfter more research, I found multiple topic talking about simular issues. \\n\\n[https://github.com/actions/setup-node/issues/922](https://github.com/actions/setup-node/issues/922)\\n\\n[https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/334](https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/334)\\n\\nFrom what I understand,  it appears this is due to problem with dynamic linking of NodeJs with some libs on the host. \\n\\nOk cool, but, how do I fix that?

So far we've managed okay with a massive Docker Compose file. But the trouble is there's a lot to manage since we're using different tools to develop (Docker + local builds) than we are when deploying (Kubernetes). And although I have been able to mitigate a lot of our issues using my own suite of automation scripts, I am spending too much time helping others getting their environment in a workable state.

The docs, while great initially, quickly fall off once you start wanting to do more complicated stuff or integrate it with modern build solutions, especially in the web space. I'm also looking at that \"Big News! Tilt is Joining Docker\" header that's been there for years at this point and getting bad vibes. I also don't like that it templates the Helm instead of installing it properly, but this is a really minor complaint.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then we have .NET Aspire. It's still very early and very Microsoft'ey. There are some neat ideas in there for .NET devs, but it's just not a good general solution if you're not developing specifically .NET on the Azure platform. FOSS is a distant afterthought here and it feels very obvious this just isn't a viable path. Instead of making Kubernetes development easier, they just pretend it doesn't exist by abstracting it away, becoming unnecessary middlemen in the process. It's just alpha, but it's a fundamentally flawed product in my opinion.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lastly, I've been at it with Skaffold. We don't develop in Google Cloud but it shouldn't really matter for what we need it to do. What I care about is making the setup process as easy and painless as possible while retaining the close relationship between local and production environment. However, then I come across an issue where I can't inject environment variables into the YAML configuration file... But only for specific properties. So essentially a massive inconsistency in the core the design IMO. Then I come to learn it's been like this for 2 years but no one got around to really doing anything about it. Shifting priorities I suppose? Also, honestly not the best documentation in my opinion.\n",

       "As the company grew bigger, processing issues in this manner in Slack turned a little bit into a mess. The biggest problem was with the accountability of the time spent on ad-hoc debugging and the overall visibility of what's going on in the dev infra. Our team lead was pushing for a change and wanted to add more structure to the process, without upsetting too many of the infra-team clients. By that time I was already a part-time devops with that team, and full-time building my own project. The project was not specifically designed for solving this kind of problem, but it was ideologically pretty close, so we decided to try to turn what we had into a tool that would help us harvest these issue-reports from Slack and turn them into a structured log of work items, RCAs, playbooks, etc. The whole experiment is still work in progress, but in the meantime I'm trying to gather more information and see if we should focus more on this case and deliver a tool specifically for DevOps teams.

       "                <em>Content: I work in a large-ish company in a department which has ~7,000 machines which are used for large-scale data-processing.  The group I am a part of (5 people, not including my manager) is in charge of keeping all of the hardware for the 7,000 machines up-and-running in addition to ensuring that all of the custom-built software is running in a manner which doesn't impact customers.\n",
       "\n",
       "My group was recently formed (about 5 years ago) and I've been working in it for 3 (this is my first \"real\" job - I have degrees in EE, CS, and Networked Systems).  The group was formed by taking a developer (my now-manager), promoting him to manager, and two operation's folk (they'll do anything you ask, as long as all the steps are listed clearly as 1), 2), 3) and there is no ambiguity and every command works flawlessly) as the senior personnel - and has slowly been grown from there.\n",
       "\n",
       "I am very frustrated by my current position and I have no idea where to go or how to improve the situation at work.  My mandate (from my manager) is to \"keep the network running\" and to \"automate away work\" (which I feel puts me squarely in DevOps space).  However, due to department policy, I do not have any access to the code-base and so I can only make non-deployed code systems and only when I am not working on operations work.\n",
       "\n",
       "I currently have little to no say in how the systems I have to support will be developed, or what \"fixes\" will be worked on by the development team, who can touch the code (in fact, the last time I pushed really hard to get a system fixed, the dev manager put the entire project on \"freeze\" and said it will no longer be supported).\n",
       "\n",
       "Our systems are fairly wide and varied (map-reduce like system, admittance system, completion tracking system, 2 report serving systems, hadoop clusters with in-house management software, a USA-wide archival system, a system to get data from the archive, etc, etc) and while I have a jack-of-all trades understanding of all the systems, they are nearly unmanageable (we get several hundred tickets everyday from anything from disks going down to customer's complaining about their reports not being present -> which we don't have any monitoring around).  I've worked on some of our procedures, but I run into a lot of red-tape.  For instance, I tried to get a program together to analyze the hardware on our machines for issues and to report it, but my manager stopped it because \"this is the job for other department <x>\" and when I talked to <x> they said \"everything is working as intended\".\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "My manager allows me to pick my own tasks, mainly because whenever I point out a problem he immediately puts me in charge of it, including coming up with the project plan, convincing co-workers to donate their time (non of these are resourced), finding my own time, measuring my own success on the project, and more.\n",
       "\n",
       "I haven't been able to convince my manager, the dev manager, or their manager (the department manager) to commit to any internal SLAs for any of the services either.  Typically, the response is along the lines of \"why would we do that?\" (how do you explain the importance of maintaining a quality of service?) or \"what do you think they should be?\" followed by \"we don't want to commit to that / how would we even commit to that?\" when I bring in suggestions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Currently, when I'm not working on day-to-day operations, I am trying to write a document which describes the services we offer (no, we don't already have one) with the hope that I can start gathering SOME metrics to define each of the services (for instance, how much data do we currently have in archive and how is it partitioned by type?) in a manner towards defining the health of the service (not that I'm super positive about management agreeing as to what the health of a service should be).\n",
       "\n",
       "I'm tired of running into instances of working long hours some weeks and being told by the development team \"the workload will drop as you get better at doing the operations\".  Simultaneously, I don't know what to do when there's a lull in the operational workload (like right now) and I could just sit around all day doing nothing.\n",
       "\n",

       "Securing an environment is a constant game of cat-and-mouse. Safety measures of all kinds can (and should) be put in place to protect against malicious actors, downtime, and other business impacting variables. A production stack can be an extremely complex system with dozens of applications, databases, networking security groups, user permissions, etc., so what are some of these safety measures and practices that can be used, and whose responsibility is it to make sure the stack is safe? The developers? Yes. Sys admins? Yep. DevOps? You bet. The point here is that everyone has a role in an organization’s security whether it’s obvious or not. Let’s take a look into the DevOps realm and see what these engineers can do to prevent, detect, and remediate potentially damaging issues.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Let’s first consider DevOps as the gatekeeper of Production - the Gandalf yelling “You shall not pass” at any engineer whose changes don’t meet some criteria. Typically one of these gatekeepers should be looking for a few things and asking some important questions:\n",
       "\n",
       "Successful test results - Is that your final answer? A hard requirement of proof of correctness of changes will help ensure that bug fix updates will actually fix issues, prove that other components aren’t newly broken, and provide repeatable steps to test features further on down the line.\n",
       "\n",
       "Supportability - How do we know this feature is working and how do we troubleshoot? Imagine being a Tier-1 support engineer when a customer calls you up complaining something isn’t working. It’s now your job to investigate and support the issue, and you start by digging into the logs. Hmm, no luck there... nothing relevant can be found. Now you happen to check the code repository for this feature and find that you’re flying totally blind. There’s no logging whatsoever! Now you’re stuck either jumping into a shell desperately trying to reproduce the issue or escalating up the chain just to try to get an idea of what could be going wrong. What a bottleneck. Relevant, concise logging is a must-have throughout all of the moving pieces of an application\n",
       "\n",
       "What about documentation? Thorough documentation would be fantastic to be able to quickly reference and resolve. Imagine having a go-to handbook with “In the event of ‘X’ do ‘Y’.” That would certainly make things a bit easier.\n",
       "\n",
       "Holding your own application code base to a high standard may be tedious sometimes, but the return on investment, even if it’s just peace of mind, is tremendous.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Now we’ll assume changes are in, approved, and ready to move up the environment chain destined for Production greatness and the DevOps engineer’s role is to usher them into the next environment. We could ‘scp’ a .tar.gz over to our host, or run a pull/checkout with our favorite source control tool directly on the host, but then we’ll realize it’s not 2006 anymore. The fundamental problems with these manual approaches are that they are not repeatable to scale, they’re very susceptible to user error (one of the many reasons ‘manual’ is a four-letter word in Ops), and they’re not guaranteed to yield the same results between executions. A better solution is to leverage an automation/orchestration framework such as Ansible, Puppet, or Chef that will give order to your deployments and eliminate the chaos. Chaos introduces uncertainty in an environment, and uncertainty means insecurity. These tools provide us with human-readable “playbooks”, “manifests”, “recipes” and other trendily named configuration mechanisms that will guarantee our deployment coverage for updates. These tools can not only deploy your own application, but keep all operating system packages up to date and effectively get your hosts to exact desired states.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our updates are now in production with the latest and greatest features. The odds are pretty good that our production environment isn’t just a single host running a static website without any other services supporting it behind the scenes. There’s probably a database to hold some dynamic content, a session caching application to let users log in, maybe an ElasticSearch server for fast search functionalities, and some other auxiliary service applications. Now the job is to stand up and protect Production from the outside world. Someone new to setting up a Production environment may stand all of these applications up on separate hosts, see that everything’s working, and call it a successful day.\n",
       "\n",
       "Where this falls short is the [implied] lack of consideration for putting services on internet-facing hosts. If your backend database that holds your customer data is accessible to the general internet, you’re going to have a bad time. Very careful knowledge of which applications communicate with which services will help an engineer set up correct private networks and firewall rules to make sure service exposure throughout the stack is safely deployed and configured. An additional environmental strategy that is often overlooked is the creation and use of ‘service users’ on a server to apply even more restrictions on sensitive applications.\n",
       "\n",
       "Having to actively manage all of these moving parts can seem daunting, but as we discussed earlier, automation is your friend. All of these setups and configurations can be organized and implemented with the orchestration tools mentioned before, and if they are, future update needs can be almost seamless and completed on the order of minutes. Imagine having to update an environment of hundreds of Linux servers to patch Java (not hard, I know) manually. This could take forever, but if instead you use Ansible you can roll that update out automatically to all hosts, in batches, or however you’d like in a repeatable, predictable manner. Personally, I love these tools. They cut down massively on deployments to all environments (including development with Vagrant!), are very easy to use, and help work and iteration move quickly. Though I praise these tools for their power, it’s not to say that if used incorrectly they can’t wreak some irrevocable havoc. After all, there’s still the end-user element, and we mustn’t forget the PEBCAK phenomenon. A real-world scenario was recently reported but found to be a hoax on the serverfault.com forum, but the risk of what was alleged is not too farfetched. User bleemboy claimed to have “rm -rf”-ed his entire company away with Ansible automation. Because these tools are designed to run what you, the user, tell them to, this could happen under the right (or very, very wrong) conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "To wrap up, enforcing policies and procedures in an organization geared towards ensuring certainty of code, packages, and permissions, will help mitigate security risk tremendously.  Automation and orchestration of these policies will open up a world of heightened control and insight to an environment putting a maintainer in a fantastic spot to deploy and manage source code and packages to respond to security issues easily and efficiently. Now go… automate all the things and such…\n",

       "hello infra people,I have an AWS resource which is alive and working. I also have that resource's definition in HCL. So far, perfect.Due to <reasons> however, the resources is not being tracked and is therefore not part of the current state. When I plan, I see it wants to create it anew. When I apply, it of course fails. So far, all good.Here's my problem now - when I import the resource into the state, it says it successfully did the import. HOWEVER, 1) the resource is not part of the list of updated resources and 2) it hasn't became part of the state for real.How is that even possible? I imported the resource correctly following its specific import syntax. In my case it's using an ID identifier, not an ARN.This is in stark contrast with another resource which was also not part of the state but which I was able to import successfully.Has anybody seen that behaviour before? Any ideas how to resolve this mystery?</em>\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "## BACKGROUND STORY\n",
       "\n",
       "Back in 2015, when I first found out about Terraform, it looked like a Valhalla to me. Terraform was about to solve the issue of provisioning complicated infrastructure – bringing together worlds of multiple cloud providers – ranging from multi-purpose giants like AWS to one-solution providers like Logentries.\n",
       "\n",
       "Together with my team we decided, that we need something to deal with the infrastructure complexity we have. For a platform based on Heroku and AWS, scaled horizontally to four clones Terraform seemed like a perfect solution. We wanted to have something that would let us realize the idea of Infrastructure as a Code – a must for a [DevOps enabled](https://smarketshq.com/devops-is-a-culture-not-a-title-prefix-b825b44dfcda) team. Advanced and feature-full Terraform is, it doesn’t come free – there is a couple of issues that you should be aware of.\n",
       "\n",
       "I will enumerate the ones that hurt us the most, and show you our means to deal with them. In the end, I will try to convince you that even with those challenges, there is a lot of room for Terraform in the tooling space.\n",
       "\n",
       "## THE PAINS\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. THE EVIL STATE\n",
       "\n",
       "First thing you will complain about, when it comes to Terraform, is the fact that it’s stateful, and the implications it brings. I personally consider two issues that it brings:\n",
       "\n",
       "* the state has to be in sync with the infrastructure all the time – that also means that you have to go all-in when it comes to provisioning – i.e. no stack modifications can be made outside of the provisioning tool\n",
       "* you have to keep the state somewhere – and this has to be a secure location as state has to carry secrets\n",
       "\n",
       "But there is a reason why the state was introduced into Terraform. It’s there to maintain the mapping between the resources represented in your definition files and the actual resources created within cloud providers. Having that, Terraform can give you a couple of advantages:\n",
       "\n",
       "* reading the state from providers (state syncing, also called refreshing), can be quite time-consuming. If we could be 100% sure that the state is accurate, we could totally resign from that, and apply the change right away\n",
       "* having ability to follow the resources that already have been created, we can easier apply renames and restructuring modifications – simply an infrastructure refactoring\n",
       "* when it comes to state, Terraform requires it to be locked before applying the changes. That means that we can assure that while we are applying changes no-one else does.\n",
       "\n",
       "I think when considering provisioning tool you should weigh up above arguments and make sure if your stack is more of a clean-sheet kinda thing, that can be recreated every time you change something, or is it rather a living organism that requires modifications while it’s still running.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. HARD TO START WITH THE EXISTING STACK\n",
       "\n",
       "Back in the early days of Terraform, its issue tracker was full of complaints from people not being able to leverage Terraform with the existing stack. The reason for it was the fact, that Terraform was not able to incorporate it into the state (to my amazement, while looking for a sign of this, I’ve found [my old PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/875) that was trying to address that issue back then 📷 ). Fortunately, the import command was introduced, and this problem has been solved (at least at the system level).\n",
       "\n",
       "But here comes another issue that is tightly connected to this – if your stack is large you are doomed to issue terraform import  \n",
       " command multiple times for each resource, that is already there. Without some nifty automation/scripting, it could be really time consuming and frustrating. When you think about it, it would be nice to import such things in a bit more smart way. This however would require Terraform to treat resources not as a flatland of resources, but as a tree. In some cases, it makes perfect sense – have a look at heroku\\_app  \n",
       " vs heroku\\_domain  \n",
       " or heroku\\_drain.  \n",
       " There is certainly a lot of room for improvement in that space.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. COMPLICATED STATE MODIFICATIONS\n",
       "\n",
       "There is one additional thing that is a bit problematic when dealing with the state. While constantly refactoring your infrastructure definition, you may end up renaming resources (changing their identifiers) or moving them deeper into modules. Such changes are unfortunately hard for Terraform to follow, and leave it in a state where it doesn’t know that certain resources are simply misplaced. If you run apply  \n",
       " again, you will end up in resource recreation, which is probably not something You always want. The good news is that there is a terraform state mv  \n",
       " command that allows you to move the logical resource around the state. The bad news is that in most of the cases you will need a lot of those.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. TRICKY CONDITIONAL LOGIC\n",
       "\n",
       "There are some people around the web who doesn’t like the fact that Terraform is not really an actual imperative programming language. To be perfectly honest I don’t share that opinion – I think the provisioning definition of the stack should be as declarative as it can – that leaves a lot less space for some deviations in the definitions. On the other hand, the conditional logic provided by Terraform is a bit tricky. For example to define a resource that is conditionally provisioned you make the resource to be a list, and use the count parameter to control it:\n",

       "I have a question regarding the gitlab runner container. Currently, I have a GitLab Runner running as a Docker container on my host machine, which executes tasks in my GitLab CI pipeline. In my `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, I specify a different custom Docker image—one with Ansible Core and Terraform installed—to run the tasks. I believe this setup is referred to as **Docker-in-Docker**.\n",
       "\n",
       "Most tasks are working fine, including Terraform `init`, `validate`, `plan`, and `deploy`. The `tfstate` files are correctly handled during the Terraform part. However, the final task, which involves running an Ansible playbook on a newly-built VM, fails with a \"network unreachable\" error. I’m not sure where the network issue is occurring.\n",
       "\n",
       "Interestingly, if I `docker exec` directly into the GitLab Runner container, I can ping and SSH to the remote host without any issues. However, when the pipeline runs, it fails to establish an SSH connection inside the task container?!\n",
       "\n",
       "Here’s the relevant command I’m using in the pipeline:\n",
       "\n",
       "    ANSIBLE_PASSWORD=$admin_password ansible-playbook -i my_artifact post-config.yml\n",
       "\n",
       "My question is: Does anyone know how to fix this issue? I’m unsure how the networking works between the custom container (used to run Ansible) and the GitLab Runner container. Do I need to specify the network mode as `host` for the job? Or is there something else I’m missing in how the containers communicate?\n",

       "    'title': 'Beware of GitLab billing issues',\n",
       "    'content': 'TL;DR - GitLab makes an egregious billing mistake, refuses to fix it, and tells a GitLab evangelist to go pound salt. If you purchase it, examine the order closely.\\n\\nSo, a little background on me: I started at a software company years ago in an IT position. Our traditional software development toolchain was overly complicated for my liking, so I set up GitLab. \\n\\nI did so well with it that I became my company\\'s first DevOps Engineer, and I got dev teams to make the switch. Not only did I present on GitLab at work, I took my GitLab evangelism on the road to enthusiasts in the area - I.E. the local Linux User Group.\\n\\nNot long ago, I ordered some GitLab licenses since more people wanted to use it. I asked to go from 57 to 75 licenses. Instead, GitLab put the order in wrong and *added* 75 licenses, bringing us to 132 total.\\n\\nAbout this time, I was pulled to a critically-important project that was way behind schedule and told not to work on anything else. When I got enough breathing room to switch back, our account manager acted like she couldn\\'t care less. The most I ever got was \"I\\'ll be sure to look into it\" or \"I\\'m still looking into it\".\\n\\nThe process dragged on for weeks. I had to nag her over and over again for updates until she finally told me that GitLab\\'s billing department had decided... not to give me a refund because it had been *too long*. How convenient, especially after dragging out the process for so long.\\n\\nI complained about this, asked for a new account manager, and got what I requested. Our new account manager took my concerns to the GitLab crew again... and got told once again that not only would we not receive a refund, GitLab wasn\\'t going to offer us any sort of compensation or credit whatsoever.\\n\\nWe\\'re a software company as well, and we would *never* treat loyal customers this way - *especially* not our power users. I\\'ve built my DevOps career around GitLab and encouraged others to do the same. That GitLab could be so tone-deaf over a problem that was clearly their fault speaks volumes to how the company has changed.\\n\\nI\\'m grateful for what GitLab has provided. It\\'s still a good product, even if I\\'m gravely concerned about its future. But I\\'m hanging up my GitLab evangelist hat. A few of my company\\'s senior developers are interested in GitLab alternatives, and I\\'ve given the thumbs-up to do a proof-of-concept with one of them later this year.\\n\\nIf you choose to use GitLab in your organization, check your bills carefully.\\n\\nUPDATE #1: Someone from GitLab\\'s \"Developer Evangelism team\" reached out to me privately and offered to look more into this.\\n\\nUPDATE #2: I did eventually get my money back, and Sid (GitLab CEO) responded to the email that I wrote him.',\n",
       "    'comments': ['Just curious, how long was it until you caught the mistake and brought it up to them?',\n",
       "     \"/r/gitlab *appears* to be staffed by employees. I'd recommend posting over there.\",\n",
       "     \"If the company you work for has a legal staff, sounds like it's time to loop them in.\\n\\nThough if you signed a contract for the additional licenses and that contract shows the 132 licenses (or 75 additional licenses), then you're probably shit out of luck.\",\n",

I hate it when crap like this happens.\\n\\nFwiw though, I've had zero problems working with Gitlab, including their billing department. They even proactively refunded an invoice when they realized we accidentally double paid it.\\n\\nThere are bad reps at every company, and I don't think it's fair to judge a company of 1500+ people based on interactions with two low level employees. Based on what you described, there's are a lot of escalation avenues you haven't explored. Contact their billing department directly. Full out the sales contract form on the website. Find the sales manager for your region on LinkedIn. When your relationship with the rep degrades to the level it sounds like it has, any communications or requests that go through them are suspect, including the handoff to the new rep. Find someone to get a fresh start with.\",\n",
       "     'I find their product superior to the competition, but their billing practices prehistoric and gross.\\n\\nIf this is a usage model, then they should just charge for the number of active users each month, and be transparent about how that is calculated. I have no idea why this is so hard - either they don\\'t care about the UX from the billing perspective, or this is just a shady way for them to collect rent from empty houses (the seats you had to \"purchase\" that didn\\'t get used).',\n",
       "     'Welcome folks... to the shit-show.  I USED to be an Gitlab evangelist also.  Some recent highlights of mine/ours are...\\n\\n\\\\#1: Gitlab decided to merge some code back in like 2018/2019 that made the squashed commit message a \"seemingly random\" commit message from the list of commits it squashed.  I bullshit you not, after further investigation it was found that this was intentional, a result of Gitlab \"dogfooding\" and ignoring what their community said.  Despite hundreds of their customers being up-in-arms about this, it took them 2 years before they fixed/reverted this absolutely ridiculous logic.  One of my customers was stuck at a version of Gitlab for 2 years because of this ridiculous change that they refused to revert.  See: [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/58805) and [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/47149)\\n\\n\\\\#2: For one year after adding \"auto-devops\" this stupid feature was force-enabled on all new repos you made automatically even if you had your entire own set of standards and frameworks in place.  This made it really challenging for my customers as any new repo anyone made would do this weird CI thing they weren\\'t expecting, ended up costing me and IT support teams hundreds of useless hours to support.  A few teams we ended up blocking anyone to allow to create repos just because it was \"less effort/support\" if we created repos for people with the Auto-devops disabled, lol.  There was no way to disable this from the get-go.  There still is no way to \"force\" all repos to use your own set of \"Gitlab CI Templates\" instead of \"autodevops\".  Gitlab simply couldn\\'t imagine \"Why would you NOT want our magical piece of crap we added that no one wants\".  I heard through the pipeline that this is a bastard child that almost no one uses and they want to deprecate, but now since \\\\_some\\\\_ people rely on it they\\'re in a tough position and can\\'t.\\n\\n\\\\#3: They eliminated their lower pricing tier about a year ago now.  This completely removes the ability to ramp-up onto Gitlab.  It\\'s a hard sell to justify $20/user for Gitlab.  I have had 6 customers ask me to pivot them off of Gitlab and onto Github Actions since this happened, and have been unable to on-board 2 new customers onto Gitlab because of this aggressive (and imnsho insane) pricing.  This \"gates\" their software to be enterprise-only, and really goes against the \"open source\" nature of it.  See [here](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/gitlab-reshuffles-its-paid-subscription-plans/) if unfamiliar.\\n\\n\\\\#4: Touching on the above, because there is no lower pricing tier, and because Gitlab has no  \"simple/free/guest/lower-cost\" users.  So even if you want a user that doesn\\'t use 99% of the features and only needs to manage others, or just review code, or anything, it is not possible.  After a lot of people being vocally pissed off about the aggressive pricing move they started a thread on this topic seen [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213185) but they basically ignore the feedback, as it continues to pile in one year later.\\n\\n\\\\#5: Touching on the above, the open-source nature/version of Gitlab is basically unusable if you want any amount of real security (aka, mandatory approvals before merging).  This is really disgusting guys.  Basic repository security shouldn\\'t cost $20/user/mo.\\n\\n\\\\#6: Please someone explain to me why their self-hosted Gitlab costs as much as Gitlab Cloud?  If I\\'m managing a cluster of Gitlab servers, and taking 100% of the responsibility and reliability of the platform, please explain to me how to justify paying $20/user/mo (or more) for this?  This make no sense, go to hell seriously.  Give me the ability to site-license, or more-reasonably price the self-hosted version.\\n\\n\\\\#7: The worst part, the WORST part u/1cewolf is that any time any of their team members find you talking negatively about them in public (like you\\'re doing now) they placate you and the community by one of their \"team\" members say publicly \"oh lets talk\" but this goes absolutely nowhere.    Check out all the links I\\'ve sent above, in each of those, many many **MANY** numerous times team members will say \"Oh let me discuss this with you privately\".  I can tell you this is absolutely just placating the public.  If someone actually lets you talk with them besides just a quick email to them, they barely \"hear you out\", theres no actioning, no response, no even discussion.  If I had to guess, there\\'s too much bureaucracy in the org and they now have no flexibility or ability/desire to improve anyone\\'s usage of their platform and really only care about themselves and their enterprise customers.  I 99% guarantee them talking to you in private will result in almost nothing, as it has for me many, many, sadly many times.\\n\\n**Reference:** Sold/Onboarded Gitlab to dozens of paying (to Gitlab) customers in the last 9 years including 3 enterprise customers, engineered an OO-like Gitlab CI framework used at all my customers successfully, engineered an slack bot voting-based deploy script based on Gitlab CI, supported dozens of gitlab servers and clusters in my career, still supporting 4 right now as we speak.  Currently because of the aggressive pricing model, only 2 of these are paid, one using self-hosted paid with only a few users.  Multiple people share some of these users to reduce cost, the other paid customer is using Gitlab Cloud.  The other two unpaid customers are using self-hosted and just dealing with no actual security and \"trusting\" that their employees wait for approvals before merging.  Their technology is solid and as much as I love it I\\'ve had nothing but issues with their support and their decisions/processes.  Fun times.',\n",

Most current monitoring solutions for Kafka show metrics about Kafka, but metrics are often aggregated and often don’t give much details on where exactly things are going wrong. Traces on the other hand shows you the exact path which a message has taken and provides lot more details. One of our focus is how we can leverage information from traces to help solving issues much faster.\\n\\nPlease have a look on a detailed blog we have written on the some problems and proposed solutions.

       "    'content': 'Hey /r/Devops community,\\n\\nI have been lurking this subreddit for couple months now, and I noticed people are complaining a lot about the \"Help me I want to get into DevOps\" topics.\\n\\nI am one of those people that created one as well, [my previous topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/sa5d6s/shifting_to_devops_from_it_need_your_help_and/) has been a lot helpful for me to forge a roadmap. I want to express my genuine gratitude again for all the help!\\n\\nI have seen a lot of people mentioning that \"People only ask these kind of questions because DevOps pays well.\",  \"They want everything handed out to them.\", \"They get the plan and never take action on it.\" and so forth.\\n\\nWhile that may be true for some cases, not every topic is to waste your time.\\n\\nI am going to use myself as the example.  I opened the previous topic  where I asked for your guys help about 5 months ago. I have since finished [100 days of Python Challenge](https://github.com/OzangunerGH/-100DaysofCodeChallenge) ( I was on Day 40 when I opened the topic) , got the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification ( [link](https://www.credly.com/badges/dee41de1-0079-431a-8d7e-4aa6e70956c7?source=linked_in_profile)), and completed the Cloud Resume Challenge ([resume website](https://ozangunercloud.ga)  [GitHub](https://github.com/OzangunerGH/Cloud-Resume-Challenge)). Both the certification, Cloud Resume Challenge was suggested by a lot of people in the topic. Now I got my eye on Terraform and Kubernetes, and I made this plan thanks to this subreddit\\'s guidance. If it wasn\\'t for this subreddit\\'s help, I may have taken a path that is not as beneficial as the one that I took.\\n\\nBack to the topic :\\n\\nYou have to agree that there are a lot of things to learn, and people get lost as to what to start out with. I think for those people that you criticize that expects everything being handed to them, the list of things they need to learn would be scary enough for them to say \" Nope , I can\\'t do this, it\\'s too much.\" and bail out. If someone still has the guts to open a topic to say :\\n\\n\"What should I learn first? Kubernetes?  Terraform?  Ansible? Python? AWS? \" I think we need to help them because as you already know, DevOps is not a beginner-friendly field.\\n\\nSo my point is, let\\'s try to be inclusive and try to address this issue without sacrificing the help to make it more a beginner-friendly field for those people trying to get in to the field.',\n",
       "    'comments': [\"I don't want to sound offensive, but what you're saying(and I bet, you just forgot to mention where it all lead) is that you were able to make some kind of roadmap and have no metric showing it's success :D\\n\\nBut back to the topic at hand: Spreading all these bits of information out into five million different posts, each with a lengthy discussion underneath doesn't help the cause.\\n\\nAnd I think, it's kind of a vicious circle.. People come here asking for help, people are helped.. so far, so good.. but over time, some many of these threads have accumulated, that searching for it doesn't help, because where do you start reading?   So people just start a new discussion.\\n\\nI also think that the devops field is hard and complicated for a reason.. Ideally, you're not exactly doing two jobs, but you have a deep understanding of two fields of expertise.   And starting off right after uni doesn't give you that or make it any easier.    Heck, a university degree usually doesn't make ANY job easier, it just gives you the tools and mindset to get started, but the actual training often happens ON the job, when theory meets reality.\\n\\nSo if you want to dive into devops right from the start, just be prepared for a lot of friction.\\n\\nIf you've worked in either development or operations before for a couple of years, you probably encountered a lot of the challenges first hand..  Ops always being late delivering anything, dev producing crappy software all the time..   If you had that experience, finding solutions for these problems becomes a lot easier.   And related to roadmaps and other learning tools, it probably eliminates half of it, because you probably picked up a lot of techniques and tools along the way already.   But I'm the kind of person that hates tool-based development and prefers to solve problems and sees adding tools without getting a major benefit from it as yet another problem :D\\n\\nThe same goes for hitting the road running.. If you're just getting started in the field, nobody's expecting you to know everything right from the start.. they'd hire a senior if they wanted that..  So expect quite a bit of the necessary training to happen on the job.  If the colleagues can't offer that, go somewhere else, because people in that company are either seriously overworked or undersocial..\\n\\nOf course salaries are ludicrous at the moment, but they're usually paid for people bringing the tools AND the experience to the table.    As a publisher, you wouldn't want to print a book by someone who just learned to write(ie. learned the tool), you want an author(ie. someone who knows how to use the tool in the real world).    And there's a shortage of GOOD people, that's why the salaries are what they are.\\n\\nAn example from another field: Medical doctors here in Europe are still considered to be paid well(although health insurance companies and privatized clinics are pressing them harder and harder for efficiency)..  And they somewhat deserve to be paid well, they save lives, they spent 6-8 years learning the job(more if they specialized in a specific part of medicine), so there are not too many people making that effort(or being able to afford such a long stint at university)..\\n\\nNow in socialist countries, I'm thinking of Cuba in particular, you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a doctor and some of them even have a second job, just to make ends meet..   They're not less qualified, there are just more of them, because most socialist governments believe that it's a good thing to have many doctors at hand and have a healthy population instead of hooking them all up to sugar and processed food for the earnings of the food industry :D\"],\n",

       "     'Yay! A Devops question I can actually answer!\\n\\nIncident Management has been part of my role as a sysadmin for about 2 years now, and after a very long and hard road we are finally at a point where its showing some results. Its all \"based\" on ITIL, but most of our tools are standard issue / data tracking software and our own home\\\\-brewed applications. The hardest part was division of labor. At first, we hired Incident Managers to handle the entire flow from detect time to problem management. It was quickly apparent that understanding ITIL and knowing our environment (dozens of acquisitions with little integration,  products still in production with only a handful of clients, mixed virtual and metal, unclear naming conventions, ect) were two different, yet equally desired, skill sets.\\n\\nSo all the engineers took crash courses in ITIL, and that was added to our workload. Most complained. Some quit. No one took it very seriously. It took a good year and a half to get a solid flow down that provided the data needed for Problem Management to do its thing. Now that we have the data that exposes our most devastating points of failure, were able to start pushing those incident times down and start fixing and automating things.\\n\\nSo, here is the bare bones. Client, monitoring, or an individual detects an incident. A bridge is opened, a notification is sent out to the team that owns that product and any other resources required, and the client facing status page is updated within the first 5 minutes. Whoever is managing the incident is collecting the data that will be used to fill out a fairly vanilla D2R3 form, updating the status page as needed, providing updates to all internal stakeholders, and possibly fixing the issue if they can do so. Once the incident is resolved everything is reset, people go back to work, and the D2R3 is handed to problem management to identify the solution to whatever caused the incident. It then generally comes back to engineering to actually \"fix\" the issue so it doesn\\'t re\\\\-occur. \\n\\nIf you have any questions about tools or process, feel free to IM me. I feel like my department has made just about every mistake possibly in adopting a pro\\\\-active, devops approach to downtime so if I can help Im happy to.  \\n',\n",

       "    'content': \"Hi, /r/devops!\\n\\nI'm a devops (mostly) engineer in the past and a product builder in the current.\\n\\nBack in the devops days we had a situation which, I assume, is typical for a lot of companies:\\n\\n* we (the devops team) owned a rather sophisticated infrastructure of servers, systems, cloud deployments, etc\\n* we had the whole eng team as our customers\\n* we had a Slack channel where, every time something would go down, people would complain about it and we had to react\\n* the channel was also filled up with general devops questions, feature requests, etc, but mostly it was all about issues with our infra\\n* we used not to create JIRA tickets for ad-hoc infra issues, just reacted to them right in Slack\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs the company grew bigger, processing issues in this manner in Slack turned a little bit into a mess. The biggest problem was with the accountability of the time spent on ad-hoc debugging and the overall visibility of what's going on in the dev infra. Our team lead was pushing for a change and wanted to add more structure to the process, without upsetting too many of the infra-team clients. By that time I was already a part-time devops with that team, and full-time building my own project. The project was not specifically designed for solving this kind of problem, but it was ideologically pretty close, so we decided to try to turn what we had into a tool that would help us harvest these issue-reports from Slack and turn them into a structured log of work items, RCAs, playbooks, etc. The whole experiment is still work in progress, but in the meantime I'm trying to gather more information and see if we should focus more on this case and deliver a tool specifically for DevOps teams. The tool would help them\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Gather issue reports, questions, feature requests, etc from Slack\\n* summarize them and create objects in 3-rd party systems (JIRA, PD, Confluence, <anything else>)\\n* potentially help with retrieving these objects back right in Slack and matching them onto new reports\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**It would help me greatly if you could answer a few questions about your team:**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Does your team also uses Slack for discussing ad-hoc issues or do you force everyone to file a ticket first?\\n* Have you ever looked into solving the issue of consolidating this information from Slack?\\n* How would rate the amount of time you spend on **\\\\[doing planned work\\\\]%** vs. **\\\\[debugging incidents reported by automation (e.g. PD alerts)\\\\]%** vs. **\\\\[working on ad-hoc stuff requested by other people\\\\]%**\\n* What systems does your team use for communication, ticketing, incident tracking, knowledge management?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLastly, here's a [link to an article](https://blog.onebar.io/track-incident-reports-in-onebar-1cb14065d8ce) where I tried to describe what we currently have, but I'm not really trying to validate whether our current approach is valid or not.

The group I am a part of (5 people, not including my manager) is in charge of keeping all of the hardware for the 7,000 machines up-and-running in addition to ensuring that all of the custom-built software is running in a manner which doesn\\'t impact customers.\\n\\nMy group was recently formed (about 5 years ago) and I\\'ve been working in it for 3 (this is my first \"real\" job - I have degrees in EE, CS, and Networked Systems).  The group was formed by taking a developer (my now-manager), promoting him to manager, and two operation\\'s folk (they\\'ll do anything you ask, as long as all the steps are listed clearly as 1), 2), 3) and there is no ambiguity and every command works flawlessly) as the senior personnel - and has slowly been grown from there.\\n\\nI am very frustrated by my current position and I have no idea where to go or how to improve the situation at work.  My mandate (from my manager) is to \"keep the network running\" and to \"automate away work\" (which I feel puts me squarely in DevOps space).  However, due to department policy, I do not have any access to the code-base and so I can only make non-deployed code systems and only when I am not working on operations work.\\n\\nI currently have little to no say in how the systems I have to support will be developed, or what \"fixes\" will be worked on by the development team, who can touch the code (in fact, the last time I pushed really hard to get a system fixed, the dev manager put the entire project on \"freeze\" and said it will no longer be supported).\\n\\nOur systems are fairly wide and varied (map-reduce like system, admittance system, completion tracking system, 2 report serving systems, hadoop clusters with in-house management software, a USA-wide archival system, a system to get data from the archive, etc, etc) and while I have a jack-of-all trades understanding of all the systems, they are nearly unmanageable (we get several hundred tickets everyday from anything from disks going down to customer\\'s complaining about their reports not being present -> which we don\\'t have any monitoring around).  I\\'ve worked on some of our procedures, but I run into a lot of red-tape.

Typically, the response is along the lines of \"why would we do that?\" (how do you explain the importance of maintaining a quality of service?) or \"what do you think they should be?\" followed by \"we don\\'t want to commit to that / how would we even commit to that?\" when I bring in suggestions.\\n\\nCurrently, when I\\'m not working on day-to-day operations, I am trying to write a document which describes the services we offer (no, we don\\'t already have one) with the hope that I can start gathering SOME metrics to define each of the services (for instance, how much data do we currently have in archive and how is it partitioned by type?) in a manner towards defining the health of the service (not that I\\'m super positive about management agreeing as to what the health of a service should be).\\n\\nI\\'m tired of running into instances of working long hours some weeks and being told by the development team \"the workload will drop as you get better at doing the operations\".

       "    'content': 'Originally from the [NopSec blog](https://www.nopsec.com/blog/know-thyself-environment/?utm_source=social&utm_campaign=reddit)\\n\\nPost by Nick Michalos\\n\\nSecuring an environment is a constant game of cat-and-mouse. Safety measures of all kinds can (and should) be put in place to protect against malicious actors, downtime, and other business impacting variables. A production stack can be an extremely complex system with dozens of applications, databases, networking security groups, user permissions, etc., so what are some of these safety measures and practices that can be used, and whose responsibility is it to make sure the stack is safe? The developers? Yes. Sys admins? Yep. DevOps? You bet. The point here is that everyone has a role in an organization’s security whether it’s obvious or not. Let’s take a look into the DevOps realm and see what these engineers can do to prevent, detect, and remediate potentially damaging issues.\\n\\n\\nLet’s first consider DevOps as the gatekeeper of Production - the Gandalf yelling “You shall not pass” at any engineer whose changes don’t meet some criteria. Typically one of these gatekeepers should be looking for a few things and asking some important questions:\\n\\nSuccessful test results - Is that your final answer? A hard requirement of proof of correctness of changes will help ensure that bug fix updates will actually fix issues, prove that other components aren’t newly broken, and provide repeatable steps to test features further on down the line.\\n\\nSupportability - How do we know this feature is working and how do we troubleshoot? Imagine being a Tier-1 support engineer when a customer calls you up complaining something isn’t working. It’s now your job to investigate and support the issue, and you start by digging into the logs. Hmm, no luck there... nothing relevant can be found. Now you happen to check the code repository for this feature and find that you’re flying totally blind. There’s no logging whatsoever! Now you’re stuck either jumping into a shell desperately trying to reproduce the issue or escalating up the chain just to try to get an idea of what could be going wrong. What a bottleneck. Relevant, concise logging is a must-have throughout all of the moving pieces of an application\\n\\nWhat about documentation? Thorough documentation would be fantastic to be able to quickly reference and resolve. Imagine having a go-to handbook with “In the event of ‘X’ do ‘Y’.” That would certainly make things a bit easier.\\n\\nHolding your own application code base to a high standard may be tedious sometimes, but the return on investment, even if it’s just peace of mind, is tremendous.\\n\\n\\nNow we’ll assume changes are in, approved, and ready to move up the environment chain destined for Production greatness and the DevOps engineer’s role is to usher them into the next environment. We could ‘scp’ a .tar.gz over to our host, or run a pull/checkout with our favorite source control tool directly on the host, but then we’ll realize it’s not 2006 anymore. The fundamental problems with these manual approaches are that they are not repeatable to scale, they’re very susceptible to user error (one of the many reasons ‘manual’ is a four-letter word in Ops), and they’re not guaranteed to yield the same results between executions. A better solution is to leverage an automation/orchestration framework such as Ansible, Puppet, or Chef that will give order to your deployments and eliminate the chaos. Chaos introduces uncertainty in an environment, and uncertainty means insecurity. These tools provide us with human-readable “playbooks”, “manifests”, “recipes” and other trendily named configuration mechanisms that will guarantee our deployment coverage for updates. These tools can not only deploy your own application, but keep all operating system packages up to date and effectively get your hosts to exact desired states.\\n\\nOur updates are now in production with the latest and greatest features. The odds are pretty good that our production environment isn’t just a single host running a static website without any other services supporting it behind the scenes. There’s probably a database to hold some dynamic content, a session caching application to let users log in, maybe an ElasticSearch server for fast search functionalities, and some other auxiliary service applications. Now the job is to stand up and protect Production from the outside world. Someone new to setting up a Production environment may stand all of these applications up on separate hosts, see that everything’s working, and call it a successful day.\\n\\nWhere this falls short is the [implied] lack of consideration for putting services on internet-facing hosts. If your backend database that holds your customer data is accessible to the general internet, you’re going to have a bad time. Very careful knowledge of which applications communicate with which services will help an engineer set up correct private networks and firewall rules to make sure service exposure throughout the stack is safely deployed and configured. An additional environmental strategy that is often overlooked is the creation and use of ‘service users’ on a server to apply even more restrictions on sensitive applications.\\n\\nHaving to actively manage all of these moving parts can seem daunting, but as we discussed earlier, automation is your friend. All of these setups and configurations can be organized and implemented with the orchestration tools mentioned before, and if they are, future update needs can be almost seamless and completed on the order of minutes. Imagine having to update an environment of hundreds of Linux servers to patch Java (not hard, I know) manually. This could take forever, but if instead you use Ansible you can roll that update out automatically to all hosts, in batches, or however you’d like in a repeatable, predictable manner. Personally, I love these tools. They cut down massively on deployments to all environments (including development with Vagrant!), are very easy to use, and help work and iteration move quickly. Though I praise these tools for their power, it’s not to say that if used incorrectly they can’t wreak some irrevocable havoc. After all, there’s still the end-user element, and we mustn’t forget the PEBCAK phenomenon. A real-world scenario was recently reported but found to be a hoax on the serverfault.com forum, but the risk of what was alleged is not too farfetched. User bleemboy claimed to have “rm -rf”-ed his entire company away with Ansible automation. Because these tools are designed to run what you, the user, tell them to, this could happen under the right (or very, very wrong) conditions.\\n\\nTo wrap up, enforcing policies and procedures in an organization geared towards ensuring certainty of code, packages, and permissions, will help mitigate security risk tremendously.  Automation and orchestration of these policies will open up a world of heightened control and insight to an environment putting a maintainer in a fantastic spot to deploy and manage source code and packages to respond to security issues easily and efficiently. Now go… automate all the things and such…\\n\\n\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nPuppet - [https://puppet.com/](https://puppet.com/)\\n\\nAnsible - [https://www.ansible.com/](https://www.ansible.com/)\\n\\nChef - [https://www.chef.io/](https://www.chef.io/)\\n\\n[http://serverfault.com/questions/769357/recovering-from-a-rm-rf](http://serverfault.com/questions/769357/recovering-from-a-rm-rf)',\n",

Basically some sort of gateway service that was hosted in our own data centers provided by a 3rd party.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t really core to our platform at all, but it was something that was important around specific transactions that I don\\'t remember at this point.\\n\\nAt times, calls to this service would just randomly start failing without any apparent reason and then recover on its own pretty quickly.  Essentially a handful of different \"connection refused\" type exceptions would happen but then it would just start working again.  \\n\\nA couple of other engineers had already taken a stab at trying to understand what was happening but had zero luck with it.\\n\\nI started by just creating a new sensor as part of our monitoring stack to start checking the network connection to the service.  To me it just seems like there was some random packet loss or errant network connection somewhere.   After an event happened again, checked the sensor and the network was working fine during the event.\\n\\nI wish I could remember what else I did to figure it out, but eventually I came to the conclusion that this crap service didn\\'t actually support HTTP 1.1 fully and was randomly breaking keep-alive requests.  I think it was probably just a subtle edge case bug on their end of some sort.\\n\\nI ended up having to extend and inject some internals in the HttpClient we were using to basically give an HttpConnection a maximum age of 5m until it got removed from the connection pool and a new one created in it\\'s place.  Once the change was deployed, it fixed the problem for good.\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to describe fully because it sounds simple; I think the fact that the failure rate would just burst up and then back down quickly was bizarre without any apparent pattern, especially because no health checks were failing and the service was working just fine.',\n",

When the server became overloaded (Azure Single Server Postgres with abysmal IO perf...) then queries would start timing out. These timeouts were a neat feature of Npgsql which handled them client side. This means after the client timeout passed, another thread would send a cancellation request and wait up to <secondary timeout> amount of time before killing or interrupting the thread doing the query.\\n\\n\\nOk, sure, seems reasonable. A thread is stuck in a blocked state waiting on the DB so another thread cancelled the query. Well, in order to cancel a query in Postgres, you need to open another database connection and send a special cancellation token to Postgres. When they new connection happens, it can hit a different pgbouncer instance that doesn\\'t know about the cancellation token from the query and happily tosses it out.\\n\\n\\nWith this in mind, the following happens\\n- DB gets overloaded with normal queries\\n- Queries timeout\\n- A new connection is opened and cancellation sent\\n- 2/3 of the time this gets tossed out since it goes to the wrong pgbouncer\\n- the pgbouncer handling the query seems the client abruptly hung up and marks the connection as dirty\\n- pgbouncer opens a new backend connection\\n- the original query runs to completion even after pgbouncer hangs up\\n- the application, being clever, implements retry and restarts the query\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAll told, you end up with potentially opening massive amounts of backends in Postgres despite conservative pgbouncer pool sizes.

I asked the following question to ChatGPT:-\\n\\nHow real are the claims that AI can now write the code as good as junior developers and now a single developer can do the work of the whole team in the software development?\\n\\nAnd ChatGPT's answer looks more real than the AI hype created by all the novice investors or CEOs:-\\n\\nThe claims that AI can now write code as well as junior developers and that a single developer can do the work of an entire team are somewhat exaggerated, but there is truth to them in certain contexts.\\n\\n### AI Writing Code:\\n- **Strengths**: AI tools like ChatGPT or Copilot can certainly assist in writing code, automating repetitive tasks, generating boilerplate code, suggesting solutions to common programming problems, and debugging. In some cases, they can even handle relatively simple code implementations and help accelerate development by offering solutions for specific programming languages or frameworks. This might mimic the work of a junior developer, particularly when the tasks are well-defined and don’t require much original problem-solving.\\n  \\n- **Limitations**: AI struggles with more complex, creative, or highly specific software development tasks. It may not understand the broader context of the project, business requirements, or architectural nuances. It also doesn’t excel at handling ambiguous, open-ended problems or designing robust, scalable systems.\\n\\n### One Developer Doing the Work of a Whole Team:\\n- **Strengths**: With AI-assisted tools, a single developer can increase their productivity, reducing time spent on repetitive tasks like writing boilerplate code, writing tests, or looking for solutions to standard problems. Tools like Copilot can give developers more time to focus on high-level architecture, optimization, and features that require more creativity and human judgment.\\n  \\n- **Limitations**: While AI can significantly improve individual productivity, it is unlikely that one developer alone can effectively replace an entire team for complex projects. Software development often involves collaboration, design, code review, testing, project management, and domain-specific expertise. AI can’t yet handle all of these areas well. Team members bring valuable experience, communication, and problem-solving skills that AI can't replace.\\n\\n### Real-World Perspective:\\nAI is a powerful tool that can assist developers, especially for junior developers or less experienced individuals, but it is far from being a complete replacement for the creativity, strategic thinking, and specialized knowledge that senior developers and development teams provide. The best outcome is likely a hybrid approach where AI complements human developers, accelerating development while maintaining the need for human oversight and creativity.\",\n",

First off, juniors aren't just cheap labor - they're your future seniors. Any experienced leader knows that.

You're left with a massive knowledge gap and no one to fill it.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom my experience running multiple tech teams, the best approach is using AI to enhance your team's capabilities while still investing in junior talent.

The task is simple garbage code that has been done 1000x before, we used to just use a library or a template, now having AI spit out the code regurgitating the examples of the code is seen is near magic? I don\\'t get it personally.\\n\\n2.) The task is complex and you have no idea how to do it. The AI is now a liability because how can you review code like this? How can you trust it? Prompt engineering and better learning to spot hallucinations are not dev skills, and now instead of learning through struggles there are no substitute for, you roll the dice with AI. Sometimes it works, if it is actually complex and novel then the AI usually fails without tons of work in debug.\\n\\n3.) The task is still complex but now you actually know what you are doing. Application of skills is still good, but in this case you potentially circumvent that. But now you have a new risk, if you could do it yourself, the AI better do it with less effort and time input. Spending 2hrs debugging and prompt hacking and reviewing isn\\'t worth it if it would have taken you 1hr. Sure, maybe the junior would have taken a day and you would have spent similar amounts of time explaining and mentoring, if not more but now here is the issue ...\\n\\nNo one spawns in as a senior dev. Senior devs were once junior devs some prior senior dev passed the torch to with great time and effort invested. There is one key difference between this time and time spent with AI solutions. You don\\'t invest in AI atm. Sure, once the AI can meaningfully learn from experience in the field and on the fly then we might be cooked, but until then, every second spent with AI is a second lost for good, while every second with a junior is time that will pay dividends later. Juniors are more work than they are Currently worth.\\n\\nSo freeing up senior dev time will undoubtedly have a positive short term result in output, but it isn\\'t long before this breaks down. There is no shortage of weakly skilled juniors in our field, there is a great shortage and a disparity of attractiveness of compensation among companies for seniors. You almost have to raise up the seniors in house, give them purpose and work life balance such that they aren\\'t as easily pouched. Another aspect of that is for a lot of people, mentoring the next generation while at times frustrating greatly contributes to job satisfaction. If they are demanded to produce more output, knowing if they lag then they are seen as replaceable by AI ... How do these companies think that will feel mentally?\\n\\nI can\\'t wait for this to blow up in 5 or 10 yrs down the road for these \"innovative CEOs\", if only the juniors weren\\'t going to suffer in the meantime. Just wait, eventually talent will be so hard to come by and in such high demand that only the highest of high paying companies will be able to course correct. Even if you do realize, this is a slow process you need current seniors to as much as juniors to keep the pipeline going.

Simple no?\\n\\nThe difficult part is splitting the process up, because there is not always a clearly defined interface to access intermediate results.

Currently, I have a GitLab Runner running as a Docker container on my host machine, which executes tasks in my GitLab CI pipeline. In my\\xa0`.gitlab-ci.yml`\\xa0file, I specify a different custom Docker image—one with Ansible Core and Terraform installed—to run the tasks. I believe this setup is referred to as\\xa0**Docker-in-Docker**.\\n\\nMost tasks are working fine, including Terraform\\xa0`init`,\\xa0`validate`,\\xa0`plan`, and\\xa0`deploy`. The\\xa0`tfstate`\\xa0files are correctly handled during the Terraform part. However, the final task, which involves running an Ansible playbook on a newly-built VM, fails with a \"network unreachable\" error. I’m not sure where the network issue is occurring.\\n\\nInterestingly, if I\\xa0`docker exec`\\xa0directly into the GitLab Runner container, I can ping and SSH to the remote host without any issues. However, when the pipeline runs, it fails to establish an SSH connection inside the task container?!\\n\\nHere’s the relevant command I’m using in the pipeline:\\n\\n    ANSIBLE_PASSWORD=$admin_password ansible-playbook -i my_artifact post-config.yml\\n\\nMy question is: Does anyone know how to fix this issue? I’m unsure how the networking works between the custom container (used to run Ansible) and the GitLab Runner container. Do I need to specify the network mode as\\xa0`host`\\xa0for the job? Or is there something else I’m missing in how the containers communicate?\\n\\nAny guidance would be greatly appreciated!',\n",

It then outputs three strings (name of the release, name of the zip file, name of the db-migration-runner-app zip file), which are then supposed to be written to the $env:GITHUB_OUTPUT file using a little powershell script.\\n\\nThe Go program is a separate repo/action that I am using in the main dotnet app workflow. It then tries to pass out the strings in the action outputs to be used in next steps, but to no avail.\\n\\nHere\\'s the relevant output part of the Go app\\'s action.yml\\n\\n      releaseName:\\n        description: \\'Name of the release\\'\\n      releaseNameZip:\\n        description: \\'Name of the release with a .zip suffix\\'\\n      migratorNameZip:\\n        description: \\'Name of the release\\'\\n\\nI\\'ve tried doing this after supposedly setting the file in the action (powershell):\\n\\n            Write-Host \"Reading github output file\"\\n            Write-Host (Get-Content -Path $env:GITHUB_OUTPUT)\\n\\nBut the runner\\'s logs show nothing.\\n\\nSo I\\'ve tried getting the $env:GITHUB_OUTPUT using the simple pwsh command:\\n\\n    $env:GITHUB_OUTPUT\\n\\nYet it shows that the variable inside the runner is empty for some reason\\n\\nI\\'m contemplating three options:\\n\\n- Commiting sudoku\\n\\n- Rewriting this action in JS and using official bindings instead of go\\n\\n- Using a different scripting language to just build + increment version + zip + upload release in one \"step\".',\n",

I\\'m currently in the process of evaluating alternative technologies for our local development environment. So far we\\'ve managed okay with a massive Docker Compose file. But the trouble is there\\'s a lot to manage since we\\'re using different tools to develop (Docker + local builds) than we are when deploying (Kubernetes). And although I have been able to mitigate a lot of our issues using my own suite of automation scripts, I am spending too much time helping others getting their environment in a workable state. So the plan was to take a look at some of these \"Internal Development Platform\" technologies to see if I can leverage some of this.\\n\\nThe tools I\\'ve had a go with so far are Tilt, .NET Aspire (we primary do .NET here), and Skaffold.\\n\\nSo far, the best experience I\\'ve had is Tilt. But one glance at their website and it\\'s immediately obvious that it\\'s not exactly a project bustling with activity. The docs, while great initially, quickly fall off once you start wanting to do more complicated stuff or integrate it with modern build solutions, especially in the web space. I\\'m also looking at that \"Big News! Tilt is Joining Docker\" header that\\'s been there for years at this point and getting bad vibes. I also don\\'t like that it templates the Helm instead of installing it properly, but this is a really minor complaint.\\n\\nThen we have .NET Aspire. It\\'s still very early and very Microsoft\\'ey. There are some neat ideas in there for .NET devs, but it\\'s just not a good general solution if you\\'re not developing specifically .NET on the Azure platform. FOSS is a distant afterthought here and it feels very obvious this just isn\\'t a viable path. Instead of making Kubernetes development easier, they just pretend it doesn\\'t exist by abstracting it away, becoming unnecessary middlemen in the process. It\\'s just alpha, but it\\'s a fundamentally flawed product in my opinion.\\n\\nLastly, I\\'ve been at it with Skaffold. We don\\'t develop in Google Cloud but it shouldn\\'t really matter for what we need it to do. What I care about is making the setup process as easy and painless as possible while retaining the close relationship between local and production environment. However, then I come across an issue where I can\\'t inject environment variables into the YAML configuration file... But only for specific properties. So essentially a massive inconsistency in the core the design IMO. Then I come to learn it\\'s been like this for 2 years but no one got around to really doing anything about it. Shifting priorities I suppose? Also, honestly not the best documentation in my opinion.\\n\\nIt all feels so... incomplete? I feel like the current landscape is quite barren in terms of good solutions to this -- I assume -- very understood and manageable problem. Develop something into a local cluster with minimal effort. Maybe I\\'m missing something, going about things the wrong way, lack the skills necessary, I\\'m honestly not trying to be a person who just complains.', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/19fhzk7/why_do_internal_development_platform_technologies/'}, {'title': 'is monitoring Kafka hard for you?

I\\'m currently in the process of evaluating alternative technologies for our local development environment. So far we\\'ve managed okay with a massive Docker Compose file. But the trouble is there\\'s a lot to manage since we\\'re using different tools to develop (Docker + local builds) than we are when deploying (Kubernetes). And although I have been able to mitigate a lot of our issues using my own suite of automation scripts, I am spending too much time helping others getting their environment in a workable state. So the plan was to take a look at some of these \"Internal Development Platform\" technologies to see if I can leverage some of this.\\n\\nThe tools I\\'ve had a go with so far are Tilt, .NET Aspire (we primary do .NET here), and Skaffold.\\n\\nSo far, the best experience I\\'ve had is Tilt. But one glance at their website and it\\'s immediately obvious that it\\'s not exactly a project bustling with activity. The docs, while great initially, quickly fall off once you start wanting to do more complicated stuff or integrate it with modern build solutions, especially in the web space. I\\'m also looking at that \"Big News! Tilt is Joining Docker\" header that\\'s been there for years at this point and getting bad vibes. I also don\\'t like that it templates the Helm instead of installing it properly, but this is a really minor complaint.\\n\\nThen we have .NET Aspire. It\\'s still very early and very Microsoft\\'ey. There are some neat ideas in there for .NET devs, but it\\'s just not a good general solution if you\\'re not developing specifically .NET on the Azure platform. FOSS is a distant afterthought here and it feels very obvious this just isn\\'t a viable path. Instead of making Kubernetes development easier, they just pretend it doesn\\'t exist by abstracting it away, becoming unnecessary middlemen in the process. It\\'s just alpha, but it\\'s a fundamentally flawed product in my opinion.\\n\\nLastly, I\\'ve been at it with Skaffold. We don\\'t develop in Google Cloud but it shouldn\\'t really matter for what we need it to do. What I care about is making the setup process as easy and painless as possible while retaining the close relationship between local and production environment. However, then I come across an issue where I can\\'t inject environment variables into the YAML configuration file... But only for specific properties. So essentially a massive inconsistency in the core the design IMO. Then I come to learn it\\'s been like this for 2 years but no one got around to really doing anything about it. Shifting priorities I suppose? Also, honestly not the best documentation in my opinion.\\n\\nIt all feels so... incomplete? I feel like the current landscape is quite barren in terms of good solutions to this -- I assume -- very understood and manageable problem. Develop something into a local cluster with minimal effort. Maybe I\\'m missing something, going about things the wrong way, lack the skills necessary, I\\'m honestly not trying to be a person who just complains.', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/19fhzk7/why_do_internal_development_platform_technologies/'}, {'title': 'is monitoring Kafka hard for you?
